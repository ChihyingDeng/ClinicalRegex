 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

Dear Dr. Singh, Dr. Passeri, Dr. Grenoble and Dr. Kusick,

 I had the pleasure to see your patient, Herbert Liebenow, today in the Re-ACT clinic for consideration of upgrade of his pacemaker to CRT.

As you know, he is a very pleasant 84 year old man with a history of ischemic cardiiomyopathy s/p CABG and aortic stenosis, who underwent TAVR (CoreValve x2) on 7/16/2014, complicated by complete AV block for which he received a Medtronic dual chamber pacemaker on 7/18/2014. After TAVR and ppm, he did not feel any improvement in symptoms (he has orthopnea and dyspnea on minimal exertion such as showering). He has a LBBB. His LVEF after TAVR is 13%.

We reached out to Mr. Liebenow at the request of Dr. Passeri's office after his repeat cardiac ultrasound came back with decreased LV function of 13% to discuss upgrade to CRT device as he is RV pacing. Thought was that his increased RV pacing was leading to worsening heart function. I spoke with Mr. Liebenow by telephone who asked that I speak with his daughter Tammy.

 Other Data:
 MLWHFQ: not completed.

6MHW: he arrived in a wheelchair, and so 6 minute walk was not performed.

 EKG:
 presentation: Sinus rhythm at 76 bpm with RV pacing, single PVC, QRS 188 ms (paced)

after pacemaker reprogramming: sinus rhythm at 78 bpm, LBBB, PR 132, QRS 176, QTc 533 ms. PVCs.

Assessment and Plan: 

Chronic systolic heart failure .. - ischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF 13% with LBBB and NYHA class III symptoms. He remains short of breath on minimal exertion despite TAVR with acceptable aortic valve function. 

Of note, he was receiving consistent RV pacing, but his complete AV block has resolved. However, he has a chronic LBBB, and so CRT is likely to be of benefit to him. He and I spoke at length about the potential benefit of CRT in this situation, in regard to CHF symptoms and mortality benefit. We also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of CRT-P vs. CRT-ICD. We discussed the procedural risks which include but are not limited to: failure to respond to CRT, pain, infection, damage to the heart/lungs/blood vessels, bleeding, heart attack, stroke or death. We also specifically discussed his baseline poor kidney function, and the possibility that the upgrade to CRT could further worsen his kidney function, and could possibly lead to permanent kidney failure. After extensive discussion, he would like to have his pacemaker upgraded to CRT-P (he does not want an ICD). He will hold lasix on the morning of the procedure to minimize the risk of kidney injury.

 Interval History:
 We reached out to Mr. Liebenow at the request of Dr. Passeri's office after his repeat cardiac ultrasound came back with decreased LV function of 13% to discuss upgrade to CRT device as he is RV pacing. Thought was that his increased RV pacing was leading to worsening heart function. I spoke with Mr. Liebenow by telephone who asked that I speak with his daughter Tammy.

Initially our administrative staff contacted his daughter Tammy who stated that she did not want her father to come in to Boston and that he should have the procedure done locally. I provided a followup phone call to examine what we done to facilitate his upgrade. One of the main issues serving as a barrier is the cost towards getting a hotel room for the family to stay locally. I explained that these procedures are done as admit after and include only an overnight stay with discharge the next morning. Tammy has asked myself along with two of the administrative staff for this to be done outpatient and we both have reviewed with her that this is not possible especially in the setting of her father's advanced age and elevated creatinine.

Dr. Singh was contacted on 9/8/14 and asked if the procedure was booked for 9/9/14- which it was not. On two different phone conversations we have reinforced the fact that we will not be covering hotel expenses and that the procedure cannot be done on an outpatient basis. It sounds as though this may have happened previously on an admission most likely in relation to some social worker needs. I explained that this is not routine for MGH procedures. We also offered to arrange if they would like the procedure done closer to home to provide him with a referral.

For now we will plan on a colleague of Dr. Singh's seeing them as part of the resynchronization clinic to do a preprocedural clearance on 9/10/14 including chest x-ray, CBC, urinalysis. He has been scheduled tentatively for 9/11/14 in the EP lab for an upgrade to a Medtronic CRT device to be done by Dr. Mela as Dr. Singh is already booked for procedures on 9/11/14.

Of note his creatinine is elevated at 3.99 on recent labs.

 Follow-up transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement. 

 Interval History:
 Mr. Liebenow is a medically complex 84 year-old man with with chronic ischemic heart disease, chronic systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and a history of severe aortic stenosis for which he underwent transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a 31 mm CoreValve. He developed complete heart block following the procedure and underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker. He was discharged to rehabilitation and, subsequently, to home about a week ago. 

He feels very weak.

Aortic valve replacement - 07/16/2014: Transfemoral TAVR 31 mm CoreValve
 - 07/16/2014: Transfemoral TAVR 31 mm CoreValve
 - His prosthtetic valve is well seated. There is mild paravalvular regurgitation, which is not uncommon with this prosthesis type. He will continue aspirin indefinitely and Plavix for six months. 

Chronic systolic heart failure .. - He continues to have at least NYHA class II to III symptoms. His left ventricular ejection fraction has declined considerably since last month in spite of essentially normal prosthetic valve function. I am concerned that it may be related to the persistent RV pacing. I will contact Dr. Singh from the EP service to see if there can be adjustments made to the pacemaker settings of it upgrade to a CRT device may be useful. 

Diabetes mellitus type 2 ...
Chronic ischemic heart disease .. - No angina. Continue medical therapy. 

Chronic kidney disease ...
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ...
Cardiac pacemaker in situ .. - As above, I think that persistent pacing may have led to the decline in left ventricular ejection fraction and worsened mitral regurgitation. I will be interested in Dr. Singh's thoughts.

Gait/balance:  Amb with RW, shuffled steps, decreased bil foot clearance, downward gaze 


Intervention: 

Bed mobility training:  Cues for PPM precautions as above 

Gait training: Cued for staying inside the walker, increasing bil foot clearance, not pushing too hard on walker w/ L arm 

Aerobic Ex. Program: Frequency: 3x/day       Intensity: slow pace Time: interval gait, short distances to start with chair follow  Type:  walking w/ RW 


Education: with pt re: interpretation of HDR and subsequent activity recommenadtions, reviewed PPM precautions and focused on maintaining them during functional tasks, discussed signs for proper termination of exercise, d/c plan for rehab 


Assessment:  Mr. Liebenow demonstrates ongoing orthostatic hypotension with activity, and was lightheaded during todays session requiring a seated rest break to recover.  He needed many reminders to maintain his PPM precautions during the session, and expect there will not be much carryover session to session.  Continue to recommend an inpatient rehab stay upon d/c from MGH. 

Plan: Continue to follow to progress interval gait, continue HDR assessment, reinforce PPM precautions 



RECOMMENDATIONS 

	  Discharge: inpatient rehab 

	  Activity: Encourage OOB to chair for meals, amb 3x/day to/from bathroom and to door and back, for further distances use chair follow, close attention to HDR

EVALUATION:  Pt is an 84yo male who presents with impaired endurance, balance, orientation, and safety awareness associated with deconditioning in setting of hospitalization.  Pt demonstrates abnormal hemodynamics with failure response to activity, 30point drop in systolic BP with short interval of ambulation. He is fairly unsteady on his feet, requires use of walker and hands on assist.  His fall risk is increased by his impaired orientation and impaired safety awareness.  Positive factors in his recovery are his baseline independence, home set-up, and family support.  Recommend inpatient PT, anticipate he will progress towards household mobility over the next 2-3 weeks.   


Anticipated Goals and Expected Outcomes: (within 7 days)   Pt will verbalize understanding of fall risk reduction strategies Pt will verbalize understanding of ppm precuations and incorporate into all mobility  Pt will transfer supine to sit with HOB flat, no bed rails and supervision assist to be able to get in and out of bed Pt will transfer sit to stand to walker with CTG to be able to get up from a chair Pt will ambulate 250ft with walker and CTG assist  

Goals/Plan discussed with and agreed to by patient and family?     Yes      


Plan of Care*:       Frequency: 4x wk  Ed: L UE ppm precautions, fall risk reduction, energy conservation Bed mobility Transfer training  Aerobic conditioning: interval gait Balance Gait Training Monitor hemodynamic response 



*The patients progress will be assessed at each session. The frequency may be increased or tapered as treatment progresses based on the therapists judgment of factors including but not limited to; co morbidities, tissue healing, patient/caregiver independent self management, ability to participate  in/receive therapy due to medical stability and/or competing care priorities.

 Reason for visit:
 CIU Transfer Accept Note: S/P transfemoral TAVR

 Interval History:
 84 yo male with severe AS (AVA 0.7) who is S/P transfemoral TAVR on 7/16 c/b CHB requiring PPM placement (DDD Medtronic) today. He is transferred from CSICU to Ell 11 for further management. 

PHx includes chronic systolic HF, LBBB, HTN, HLD, COPD, CKD 4 (Bl Cr 3.3 - 3.6), CAD, S/P CABG. A Cardiac cath in Dec '13 revealed 3 VD and patent LIMA to LAD, patent SVG to RI, patent SVG Y graft to RCA - PDA.

DUring the stent-valve placement, a moderate paravalvular leak was noted. It did not improve with post dilation and a second valve was placed. Post TAVR echo revealed mild paravalvular leak and no AI. EF 35% (29% in Dec '13). No effusion.

Additionally, there was concern for esophageal injury following TEE and he was placed on IV Nexium.

His plts have dropped from 166 on admission -> 69 today and he received a 6-pack of plts prior to PPM placement. His plts have been low normal in the past with occasional dips into the 130s. His Hct has dropped 10 points since admission from 37.9 -> 27.9. 

According to CSICU NP, VSS and he has had no melena or hematemesis. The hct drop is attributed to dilution from high volume fluids post procedure.

 Narrative Note:
 CSICU Transfer Note to Ellison Cardiology
Name: Liebenow, Herbert
MRN: 5230639
Date of Admission: 7/15/14
Date of Transfer: 7/18/14
Code status: FULL

HPI: Mr. Liebenow is an 84 year-old gentleman with CAD, prior CABG, symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, chronic systolic heart failure, stage 5 CKD, COPD and DMII. He had previously been evaluated for surgical aortic valve replacement and been found to be at extreme risk for death or major morbidity. He was determined to be an appropriate candidate for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). He underwent transfemoral TAVR with commercial core valve with Dr. Melnitchouk on 7/16/14. Following the case, he was admitted to the CSICU.

CSICU course: Mr. Leibenow was extubated on POD #0 to nasal cannula, with good O2 sats. He is awake and alert and gets OOB to chair. He was started on milrinone intraop for low CIs which was successfully weaned off on POD #1 with normal CI. His levophed weaned off on POD#2 with normal BP. Of note, he has a preexisting LBBB, which degenerated to a CHB with escape rate in 30s on POD#2, at which point the EP service was consulted. A Medtronic PPM was placed on 7/18/14. It is currently set to DDD 60. He was maintained on a H2 blocker (PPI held with concurrent Plavix use) and bowel regimen. There was some concern for possible esophageal injury when the transesophageal echo was performed intra-op due to difficulty of insertion. Thus far, he is tolerating clears without any difficulty swallowing. His creatinine is 3.99 which is approximately his baseline level. He makes adequate urine and maintains his electrolytes on his home dose Lasix. He received a modified plavix load and is now on plavix 75mg QD and ASA 81mg QD. He completed a course of periop zosyn (given concerns of esophageal injury). He is currently receiving 2 doses of Ancef for prophylaxis after PPM placement. He is followed by Dr. Godine for his diabetes management and is maintained on an insulin regimen. He is medically stable for transfer to Ellison 11.

Electrophysiology consultation at the request of Dr. William Hoffman.

 Mr. Liebenow is 84-year-old man with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease status-post CABG and symptomatic severe aortic stenosis status-post TAVR with transfemoral CoreValve 31 mm complicated by paravalvular leak status-post second CoreValve 31 mm. 

The patient was noted to be in third-degree AV block on post-procedure day 3 and temporary transvenous RV pacing was initiated. Underlying rhythm appears to be sinus bradycardia in 40's with junctional escape, baseline LBBB. Hemodynamically tolerated. The patient with asymptomatic and specifically denies chest pain/pressure, dyspnea/orthopnea, fever, chills, night sweats or localizing symptoms. 

Of note, peri-procedurally, there was concern for esophageal perforation and empiric Zosyn was started. WBC mildly elevated today to 12.2, plt with linear daily downtrend at 66 from 84 < 122 < 166 with mild anemia. TEE with mild anterolateral paravalvular leak, EF 35%, AVA 1.4, mean gradient 12 mmHg. 

The electrophysiology service was consulted for consideration of PPM placement.

 EKG:
 AV-paced at 80. Underlying rhythm sinus bradycardia in 40's with junctional escape, baseline LBBB.

 Assessment and plan:
 84-year-old man with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease status-post CABG and symptomatic severe aortic stenosis status-post TAVR with transfemoral CoreValve 31 mm complicated by paravalvular leak status-post second CoreValve 31 mm, post-procedure course further complicated by complete heart block. 

The patient presents with two indications for pacemaker placement. Complete heart block requiring transvenous pacing and secondly, slow underlying bradycardia in a patient status-post valve replacement. Given underling conduction disease and CoreValve placement, CHB is not unexpected. The patient, however, presents higher than average procedural risk given thrombocytopenia concerning for secondary process such hemolysis due to paravalvular shearing and/or HIT. 

Recommendations: 
- Patient will be add-on for PPM today, please keep NPO 
- Transfuse 6-pack platelets prior to procedure 
- Defer thrombocytopenia evaluation to primary team 
- Monitor WBC trend and any s/s of infection

Patient evaluated in detail. Discussed with Dr. Nakamura and Hoffman. Briefly, a 84-year-old man with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease status-post CABG and symptomatic severe aortic stenosis status-post TAVR with transfemoral CoreValve 31 mm complicated by paravalvular leak status-post second CoreValve 31 mm, post-procedure course further complicated by complete heart block. He clearly needs a PPM. He is a high risk candidate in the setting of i) his recent procedure ii) ESRD, iii) low platelets. He is on antibiotics. He will get a 6-pack of platelets following which he will get a PPM later today.

He has had diabetes for ~15 years, was initially on pills, but has been on insulin for an uncertain period. His pre-op regimen consisted of Lantus 10 Units at bedtime and Humalog (?doses) AC. His A1c is 7.3%. 

Retinopathy:   ? no retinopathy 

Nephropathy:  He has CRI with baseline creatinine 3+ and has been seen by Dr. Steele. There are contributions from renovascular disease, hypertension, nephrolithiasis as well as diabetes 

Neuropathy:    No information 

Cardiac:           He is s/p CABG in 1995 and has chronic systolic heart failure

History of present illness:
84 year male with severe aortic stenosis, admitted for planned elective TAVR. He has a history of CAD s/p CABG, ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 29%, stage 4 CKD, Type II DM, LBBB, COPD, HTN, HLD and aortic stenosis. His symptoms have been fatigue and dyspnea on exertion, some worsening over the past 2-3 months. He has occasional chest pain and dizziness with symptoms. His TAVR for 6/18 was postponed due to a + UTI. He was discharged with cipro. 

His cardiac work up includes: 

ECHO on 12/12/13 revealed LVEF 29%, LA 36 mm, LVID-d 58 mm, LVID-s 49 mm, IVS 13 mm, PWT 12 mm. There is incomplete closure of the mitral valve leaflets complicated with papillary muscle displacement. He has moderate MR. He has aortic stenosis with AVA 0.7 cm2 and mean trans AV gradient is 36 mmHG, peak gradient 62 mm Hg. There is symmetric LVH, LV diffusely hypokinetic with regional variation. There is evidence of trace pulmonary insufficiency. 

CNIS on 12/12/13 revealed moderate 50-69% right internal carotid artery stenosis, mild 20-49% left internal carotid artery stenosis. 

He had cardiac catheterization on 12/16/13 that revealed SVG-Ramus, SVG-distal RCA and right PDA ad LIMA-distal LAD are all patent. 

Since admission to Ellison 11, the patient has been hemodynamically stable and painfree. On interview, the patient confirmed the above mentioned symptoms. Cardiac review of systems is negative for orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations or claudication.

Following a discussion of risks and benefits of the examination, consent was
obtained from the patient. Local oropharyngeal anesthesia was achieved with 4%
topical lidocaine gargle and 20% benzocaine spray. Sedation was administered
by a cardiac anesthesiologist. The TEE probe was introduced and removed with
no palpable resistance. The patient tolerated the procedure and there were no
complications. No adverse reaction to medication was noted.

 DIAGNOSES 
 SEMI initial episode of care
 Aortic stenosis: Nonrheumatic 
 INDICATION(S)/BACKGROUND: Aortic valve disorder (AI, AR, AS) 
 (non-rheumatic)

 DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUE: Under Lidocaine 2% local anesthesia a 7 F 
 introducer was placed in the right femoral vein. A 7 F balloon tipped 
 catheter was introduced via the venous sheath, the balloon was inflated 
 and catheter was advanced through the right heart chambers into the 
 pulmonary capillary wedge position. Right sided pressures were 
 obtained. Cardiac output was measured using Thermodilution. 

 Under Lidocaine 2% local anesthesia a 5F introducer was placed in the 
 right femoral artery using modified Seldinger technique. Selective 
 coronary arteriography was then performed using a 5 F Judkins left 
 number 4 catheter to engage the left coronary artery and a 5 F Judkins 
 right number 4 catheter to engage the right coronary artery. Right and 
 left coronary arteriography were performed in multiple views by hand 
 injections of Ultravist. Following the procedure, the sheath was 
 removed. Selective left internal mammary graft angiography was then 
 performed using Judkins right number 4 catheter to engage the arterial 
 graft conduit to the first diagonal coronary artery. Angiography was 
 performed in multiple views by hand injections of Ultravist. 
 Selective saphenous vein graft angiography was then performed using 
 Judkins right number 4 catheter to sequentially engage the ostia of 
 saphenous vein grafts to ramus coronary artery, right coronary artery, 
 and posterior descending coronary artery. Angiography of each graft was 
 performed in multiple views by hand injections of Ultravist. No 
 additional grafts were noted using LCB catheter. Aortogram was deferred 
 in setting of advanced CKD.

 CORONARY ANATOMY FINDINGS 
 Dominance: Right
 Left Main: The left main coronary artery is of moderate length, 
 intermediate sized vessel. It bifurcates into the LAD and LCX coronary 
 arteries. Left main coronary artery contains only minimal 
 irregularities. 
 LAD: The left anterior descending artery is large vessel, which 
 reaches beyond the apex of the heart and gives origin to three moderate 
 sized diagonal arteries. The Mid LAD has a focal 100 % stenosis in its 
 proximal third. 
 Left Circumflex: The left circumflex coronary artery is moderate sized 
 vessel, which gives origin to one obtuse marginal arteries. The 
 Proximal Circumflex has a focal 75 % stenosis in its mid third. The 
 Mid Circumflex has a focal 100 % stenosis in its proximal third just 
 after OM1 takeoff. 
 RCA: The right coronary artery is a large vessel. The Proximal RCA 
 has a focal 100 % stenosis in its proximal third. 
 Grafts: The Saphenous vein graft to Ramus is patent. The Y saphenous 
 vein graft to Distal RCA and Right PDA. The Y LIMA graft to Distal LAD 
 and first diagonal branch is patent.

CC: Dyspnea, AICD fire x 2 


Source: BIDMC records. Pt history limited 2/2 pt w/ very dry throat and mouth -> difficulty speaking 


HPI: 57 M w/ DCM 2/2 Chagas disease, MR s/p MV repair 2/3/06 admitted to the BIDMC for progressive dyspnea and AICD firing on 1/21/06. He had two AICD discharges on 1/19 and 1/21 before BIDMC evaluation. He had a prodrome of dizziness without chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea before each AICD. EP evaluation on 1/19/06 at BIDMC demonstrated appropriate discharge for VT. He then had his amiodarone increased to 400 mg POBID from 200 mg POQD.  


On admission, he was given IV amiodarone and developed two episodes of VT/VF during the night. Anti-tachycardia pacing failed and he was shocked into SR. He was then given Lidocaine IV and transitioned to mexilitine. However, during this time he was hypotensive with a palpable pulse. He was intubated and transferred to the CCU on 1/22/06. He was Cathed on 1/25/06 without critical CAD. He also had an EP study without finding an inducible source for his VT. His studies are summarized below.

ON 2/3/06 he was taken to the OR and had a MV repair with 28 mm annuloplasty ring. During his post-operative course he continued to have runs of NSVT. His course was complicated by a left arm thrombophlebitis from an IV on 2/8/06 and a single BCx with coag negative staph. All other BCx were negative. He was covered with Vancomycin. He was extubated on 2/12/06. He had a fever 101.5 on 2/14/06 and an ID consult was  

obtained. All cultures were negative. He was eventually treated with levofloxacin.  


He was also found to have an asymptomatic pancreatitis on lab check on 2/15/06. Amylase was 587. He was made NPO at this time. He then had multiple medications stopped for concern for hepatotoxicity. RUQ U/S was negative for CBD dilation. CT scan on 2/18/06 was negative for pancreatitis, but noted to have left hepatic lobe atrophy. His amylase continued to trend up to 800s. However, he was asymptomatic during this time. He has remained NPO since then. 


He continued to have intermittent NSVT with some changes between Amiodarone, Lidocaine, and mexilitine, but eventually he was placed on IV amiodarone and lidocaine after his AICD discharged 3 times over the last 2 days.  


He currently denies fever, chills, sweats, rigors, CP, palpitations, SOB, Cough, hemoptysis, sputum, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, N/V, melena, hematochezia, or changes in BM. He denies current change in memory, concentration, speech, coordination, movement, sensorium, diplopia, taste, or smell

DATE OF ADMISSION:  06/22/2010. 


PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  Michael Zito, M.D. 


REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Alberto Ramirez, M.D. 


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dizziness, near syncope with bradycardia. 


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 83-year-old gentleman with a history of moderate-to-severe LV dysfunction, EF 30% by echo in 2004, presumably due to alcohol conduction system disease with bifascicular block, hypertension, type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease stage III, who according to his son had significant dizziness and nearly fainted on 06/22/2010 in the morning.  He was brought to his physician who diagnosed complete heart block with heart rates in the 30s.  He went to the Faulkner Hospital, where he was evaluated by Cardiology.  It was felt that he was stable and did not require temporary pacemaker after having responded to atropine and measures to reverse mild hyperkalemia.  Of note, the potassium was 5.3 with a creatinine 1.5 on initial evaluation in Emergency Department. 


According to his son, he had experienced increasing shortness of breath in the days preceding while ambulating the house.  Two days prior to admission, he had a dizzy episode in the chair doing a crossword puzzle.  He also had urinary incontinence, which is new for him.  He sometimes noted visual blurriness without diaphoresis, numbness, focal neurologic signs, loss of motor function, speech or vision.  Symptoms typically resolved after 5 minutes.  After multiple episodes, he decided to seek evaluation. 


He was admitted to the Faulkner Medical Floor for monitoring and had his beta-blocker held.  Plans were to evaluate him for a pacemaker after washout of the beta-blocker, which had been in his usual stable dose of atenolol, unchanged for 3 years.  Of note, he had recently had spironolactone added to his regimen 3-4 weeks prior.  Shortly upon arrival to the floor at 5:30 p.m. at the Faulkner Hospital, he had a prolonged pause on telemetry, although he was asymptomatic.  He was given glucagon.  Heart rate felt to the 30s and he became dizzy.  Transcutaneous temporary pacing was initiated at 70 beats per minute and he improved.  His blood glucose was 150, systolic blood pressure 120 and he felt better.  Atropine 0.6 mg was given and his heart rate stabilized in the 50s with a blood pressure of 103.  At that point, he was referred to BWH for placement of a pacemaker. 


En route from ambulance to the catheterization lab for temporary venous wire, he had progressive bradycardic arrest requiring 2 minutes of CPR.  Transcutaneous pacer was turned on at 60 beats per minute and he arrived to the catheterization lab with a blood pressure of 70/40.  O2 saturation is 72%.  He had emergent placement of venous temporary pacing wire via the right femoral vein.  He is paced at 90 and his blood pressure increased to 130 systolic.  His O2 saturations improved to the 90s.  He was placed on a 100% nonrebreather mask.  Initial plan was to intubate him; however, he did turn around with the temporary pacing wire.  The underlying rhythm appeared to be atrial fibrillation or flutter with a very slow ventricular escape.  He had frequent ventricular ectopy and some short runs of NSVT.  He subsequently admitted.  He also underwent a coronary angiogram, which revealed only a 40% mid RCA stenosis and no other angiographically evident disease.  He was then admitted to the CCU for further evaluation and management.  His filling pressures on right heart catheterization in the catheterization lab reveals RA 13, RV 49/8, PA 53/18.  The capture threshold on the temporary venous wire was 0.1 milliamps, output 4 milliamps, rate 100. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for CHF with an EF of 30% with dilated ventricles.  He has a history of significant alcohol intake having stopped 4 years ago.  He has type 2 diabetes.  He is on insulin.  Complications include peripheral neuropathy and macular degeneration as well as renal failure.  He has stage III chronic kidney disease with creatinine in the low 2s.  Hypertension; glaucoma; mild thrombocytopenia; adrenal insufficiency, on hydrocortisone.  Ten years ago, he had a severe peptic ulcer with perforation requiring 1-month stay in the ICU including a tracheostomy and PEG. 


HOME MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, metformin, spironolactone, hydrocortisone, atenolol 75 mg daily, folic acid, vitamin B1, magnesium, MVI, Tums and Tylenol. 


ALLERGIES:  None. 


FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory. 


SOCIAL HISTORY:  He denies any recent smoking or alcohol, although he did drink regularly prior to 2006.  He currently lives alone.  His wife having passed away 12 years ago.  He has a son, who is involved in his care.  The patient currently lives in Hyde Park, Massachusetts. 


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for cough and yellowish sputum.  No fevers, chills, sweats.  No abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.  No recent GI bleeding.  Other pertinent ROS is negative. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate is 60 and paced.  Blood pressure 112/62, respirations 18 and O2 saturation 96% on 3 liters.  He is lying comfortably in bed, slightly drowsy from medications peri-procedural.  He had been alert and oriented x3 at the Faulkner Hospital prior to transfer.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Conjunctivae pale.  Oropharynx benign without exudates or lesions, normal palate.  NECK:  CVP is 12 cm of water.  Carotids 2+ bilaterally with normal upstrokes and no bruits.  Lungs revealed decreased breath sounds with bibasilar rales one-third of the way up.  CARDIAC:  Distant heart tones, bradycardic regular rhythm.  No murmur, rub or gallop was noted.  ABDOMEN:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.  No HSM, masses, AAA or bruits.  EXTREMITIES:  1+ pitting edema.  Distal pulses positive by Doppler.  Feet are slightly cool.  NEUROLOGIC:  Upper and lower, motor and sensory are intact.  SKIN:  No rashes or lesions.  JOINTS:  No effusions, erythema or warmth. 


Electrocardiogram, 06/22/2010 at 1313 from Faulkner reveals atrial fibrillation with left axis deviation, right bundle-branch block, LVH with QRS widening and repolarization abnormality.  Question of an old IMI is present. 


LABORATORY DATA:  From 06/22/2010 at Faulkner Hospital include INR of 1.2.  PTT 29, sodium 137, potassium 5.3, chloride 103, bicarbonate 24, BUN 59, creatinine 1.5, GFR 47, glucose 335, total protein 6.8, albumin 3.9, calcium 9.2, total bilirubin 1.1, alkaline phosphatase 125, ALT 21, AST 19.  CK 36, troponin T 0.01, TSH 1.6.  NT-proBNP markedly elevated at 9325, white count 10.1, hemoglobin 10.9, hematocrit 33.6 and platelet count 120,000.  Blood gas at 2136 at Faulkner Hospital revealed pH of 7.29, pCO2 of 50, pO2 267. 


Chest x-ray from 06/22/2010 at 1325 from Faulkner Hospital reveals no evidence of active pulmonary disease. 


IMPRESSION: 

1.  High-degree heart block in a patient with moderate-to-severe dilated cardiomyopathy, underlying severe multi-fascicular conduction system disease with renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia and chronic beta-blocker therapy with atenolol leading to bradycardic arrest with 2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  He is now stabilized after a temporary wire placement, correction of hyperkalemia and holding beta-blockade.  The atrial mechanism is flutter/fibrillation. 

2.  Moderate-to-severe dilated cardiomyopathy with nonobstructive coronary artery disease.  Presumably, the underlying etiology is alcohol, although this has not been clearly established and he has not had a complete evaluation.  Currently, filling pressures are mildly elevated with moderate pulmonary hypertension. 

3.  Frequent ventricular ectopy with short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia post bradycardic arrest.  LV function is moderate-to-severely depressed by echo from 2004.  He has been managed with beta-blocker.  He has had no sustained runs of  ventricular tachycardia.  No documentation of sudden cardiac death.  He did have several episodes of near syncope preceding admission, although he denies any sustained palpitations preceding those events. 

4.  Chronic kidney disease, stage III. 

5.  Diabetes mellitus with multiple end-organ complications. 

6.  Coronary artery disease risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes.  He does have a 40% RCA stenosis at angiography today and no other angiographically evident disease.  This does not appear to be an acute coronary syndrome explaining the current presentation. 

7.  Urinalysis revealing pyuria consistent with urinary tract infection and probable exacerbation of renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia.  Urine cultures are pending. 

8. History of a large peptic ulcer hemorrhage with perforation resulting in a 1 month hospital stay in 2000. 

9. Adrenal insufficiency on hydrocortisone x 10 years. 


PLAN:  He does have the temporary venous wire placed and we will correct underlying causes of conduction system disturbance including hyperkalemia, renal insufficiency, UTI.  This does not appear to be ischemia mediated.  He does, however, have a history of heavy alcohol use and chronic steroids x 10 years.  Atenolol, a renally cleared beta-blocker, may be contributing and will be held.  The Electrophysiology and CHF Services has been consulted.  It appears he would be a suitable candidate for cardiac resynchronization therapy with biventricular pacing and a defibrillator.  We first will address his code status. 


The atrial mechanism is fibrillation/flutter, however, because of the large GIB in 2000, he was advised not to take antiplatelets or anticoagulants.  This will be readdressed with his physicians.  Stools will be guaiaced and GI prophylaxis administered. 


Antibiotics have been started empirically for what appears to be a urinary tract infection.  Ultimately, we will transition him to a more optimal heart failure regimen that includes non-renally cleared beta-blocker or combined alpha beta-blocker, diuretic, and afterload reduction.  At the moment since he is volume overloaded and hyperkalemic, we will use Lasix as to prefer diuretic to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters over the next 24 hours. 


Echocardiogram has been ordered since he has not had one for 6 years according to the current record.  However, it does not appear that valvular heart disease is contributing as per the clinical examination.  We will manage his nonobstructive coronary artery disease with statin and beta-blocker and discuss with the patient and his physicians safety of preinitiating either low-dose enteric-coated aspirin or Plavix in light of his severe peptic ulcer bleed 10 years ago with perforation. 


Anticipate he will stay in the ICU for approximately 2 days with aiming towards implantation of a CRT-D device in 2-3 days.

CC: transferred to brigham for pacemaker insertion; came to CCU after coding on way to cath lab 


HPI: (history obtained from son)  Pt is a 83 yo male with a history of HTN, CHF with EF of 30% (last echo in our system 9/2004), type II diabetes, CKD (bl Cr 1.4) who was taken to the Faulkner hospital by his neighbor after he experienced significant dizziness earlier today, found to be bradycardic to the 30s, and ultimately transferred to the Brigham CCU after arresting on in route to receive a pacemaker.  According to the son, the patient has had several episodes of feeling winded over the last few weeks.  More specifically, three days ago the patient experienced many episodes of dyspnea on exertion while walking around his house. Two days ago, he reports experiencing an episode in which he became dizzy while sitting in a chair.  his son reports that his eyes rolled back but he eventually "came out of it" after a few minutes.   Also experienced urinary incontinence. The dizziness was associated with visual blurring, but denies any diaphoresis, numbness, focal neurologic signs, chest pain, or syncope.  He was transported by EMS to the faulkner hospital ER with HR in 30's-50's and bp in the  110's/50's.  In the Faulkner ER, he was asymptomatic with HR in 40-50s with BP 110/60.  EKG demonstrated complete heart block with old RBBB and old Left anterior fascicular block. Hyperkalemia at 5.3, Cr 1.5. Fingerstick glucose 335.  He was given kayexalate po x1, 4U insulin, and 1L NS and cardiology was consulted.  he was admitted to floor for monitoring while holding beta-blocker and likely evaluation for pacer if not improved. Of note, patient denies taking more atenolol than normal and had not changed dose in 3 years. Only med change is spironolactone added 3-4 weeks ago. 


Shortly after arrival to floor, a rapid response was called after prolonged pause on telemetry, patient asymptomatic. Pt given glucagon 2mg. Became bradycardic to 30s with symptoms of dizziness but no LOC. Temporary pacing initated at 70bpm with improvement in symptoms, 2mg morphine given. Blood glucose 150. BP 120s/70s, symptoms resolved. Stopped pacing, 0.6mg atropine given and HR stable 50-54, asymptomatic. BP 103/55.  Decision was made to transfer the patient to BWH cath lab to receive a pacemaker.   


In route from amulance to cath lab, patient arrested and required 2 minutes of CPR.  After that, patient was transcutaneously paced at 60bpm.  He arrived at cath lab with a BP of 70/40 and o2 sat of 72%.  temporal pacing wire was placed emergently in patients right femoral vein.  after being temporarily paced at 90, his BP increased to >130 systolic with o2 sats in high 90s, so he was maintained on 100% non-rebreather.  underlying rhythm was afib with slow ventricular escape and episodes of NSVT, and patient was admitted to CCU.

CC: SOB and dizzy spells x 3d, DOE 

HPI: Pt is a 83 yo male with a history of HTN, CHF with EF of 30% (last echo in our system 9/2004), type II diabetes, CKD (bl Cr 1.4) who was in his NSOH until 3 days ago, when he developed DOE while cleaning his home. Since this time, he has experienced increasing SOB while ambulating around his home. Two days ago, he reports experiencing a "dizzy episode" while sitting in a chair doing a crossword puzzle. Also experienced urinary incontinence. The dizziness was associated with visual blurriness, but no diaphoresis, numbness, focal neurologic signs, chest pain, or syncope. Denies orthopnea. The episode resolved after 5 min. He experienced multiple subsequent episodes. He was transported by EMS to FH ER with HR in 30's-50's and bp in the  110's/50's.  


In the ER, he was asymptomatic with HR in 40-50s but majority in 50s, BP 110/60. Lytes demonstrated hyperkalemia at 5.3, Cr 1.5. EKG demonstrated complete heart block with old RBBB and old Left anterior fascicular block. Fingerstick glucose 335. He was given kayexalate po x1, 4U insulin, and 1L NS and cardiology was consulted, with decision to admit to the floor for monitoring while holding b-blocker and likely evaluation for pacer if not improved. Patient denies taking more atenolol than normal and had not changed dose in 3 years. Only med change is spironolactone added 3-4 weeks ago. No known tick bites or rashes. Last meal was at 8:00am. 


Shortly after arrival to floor at 5:30pm, a rapid response was called after prolonged pause on telemetry, patient asymptomatic. Pt given glucagon 2mg.

HPI: Ms. Margaret Cummings is a 62F PMH idiopathic dilated CM (EF 15%) s/p AICD (2006), recent TIA on plavix, obesity, and hypothyroidism who presented to her Cardiologist (Dr. Sarswat) w/progressive LE edema, orthopnea, fatigue, and DOE over the last 2 weeks. The most notable symptom is the worsening DOE, which now limits her to walking 20-30 feet at a time. She reports a 9lbs weight gain over this period, despite recent initiation of low-dose PO lasix. She has not experienced any CP or palpitations. An initial evaluation found the patient to have cool extremities and given concern for decompensated heart failure, she was sent to the MGH ED. 


Notably, Ms. Cummings had recently established her cardiac care here at MGH and was having a number of medication adjustments made, including a change from lisinopril to losartan, and an increase in her spironolactone. She had also been started on a low Na diet.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

Note: There is an addendum for this note (1/7/2014) 

 Reason for visit:
 evaluation for heart failure

 Interval History:
 Patient is a 62 yo F with a nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, previous TIA and AICD who was initially seen by me 2 weeks ago for an initial evaluatino. She was found to be mildly volume overloaded and started on low dose lasix. She was asked to switch to a low salt diet, weigh herself daily and call if she did not lose weight. Her lisinopril was switched to losartan and her spironolactone was titrated up.

I received a phone call from a friend of her's who is a nurse yesterday evening who was concerned that she had worsening lower extremity edema. She was asked to come in to clinic today for an urgent evaluation.

Today, she states she has developed extensive leg swelling in the past two weeks. She has not weighed herself at all but thinks her diet is less salty, mostly because she has not had the energy to eat. She has had decreased energy and worsening unsteadiness since our last visit. She had labs, but has not seen neuro or psychiatry and has not had an echocardiogram. Her cough is better with a switch from lisinopril to losartan. She has not had any palpitations or chest pain. Her exercise tolerance is now limited to her home and she has been having problems with activities of daily living due to weakness and dyspnea. She has also had nausea and a poor appetite. She feels she is unable to manage at home and wants to be admitted to "get all of this taken care of."

Patient is a 62 yo F with a non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, VF s/p appropriate ICD shocks, obesity and fasting hyperglycemia here with acute on chronic systolic heart failure.

Acute on chronic systolic heart failure . - 1. She is quite volume overloaded and likely in a low output state. She will be sent to the emergency room immediately for labs, IV diuretics and nitro gtt if her BP tolerates. If her condition does not improve, she will likely need a RHC and tailored therapy.

2. She has not yet had an echocardiogram here. Will obtain one today. 

3. Continue metoprolol, losartan and spironolactone.

4. Will need interrogation of her AICD.

5. She does have a wide IVCD on her ECG and may benefit from CRT-D eventually.

Transient ischemic attack . - She reportedly had a TIA earlier. She has been on plavix. Will need a formal neuro evaluation.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 evaluation for heart failure

 Interval History:
 Patient is a 62 yo F who presents for a second opinion for her heart failure.

Review of records indicates that she was diagnosed with an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 1999. A cath at the time showed normal coronary arteries. Her EF was 30%. She was placed on neurohormonal blocking medications and eventually an ICD was placed. It seems she did well with no evidence of heart failure symptoms, NYHA I until last year. In October of 2012, she had a syncopal episode and was admitted to the hospital where she was found to have had an appropriate shock for rapid monomorphic VT vs VF. She had a stress test at the time with no ischemia.

She had another similar episode in January 2013. Her AICD again revealed an appropriate shock for VF. She was started on amiodarone at the time and maintained on oral therapy. She had a cardiac cath with normal coronary arteries. After her discharge, she reportedly had some mental status changes of an unclear origin. Review of ECG reports in clinic notes indicates that she did develop a LBBB during that course.

She did well until October 2013, when she presented with R hand weakness and was found to have a TIA. Interrogation of her ICD revealed no arrythmias including no afib. She was placed on plavix. She has been intolerant to statins. 

She is here today for a second opinion and is concerned that she is not getting the best care. She gets short of breath with one block of exertion for years. She has no chest pain or palpitations. She has had PND for 6 months, uses an inhaler, gets better with getting walking around. She sleeps often with the head of the bed up to 45 degrees for the last year. She has no LE edema. She last saw her cardiologist within the past month. 

She drinks one bottle of ice tea a day. She has been very anxious and not eating well. She eats lots of chips, etc.

Assessment and Plan: 
Patient is a 62 yo F with a non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, VF s/p appropriate ICD shocks, obesity and fasting hyperglycemia here for an initial evaluation.

Acute on chronic systolic heart failure . - 1. Volume: She is volume overloaded and is currently not on any diuretics. Will start lasix 20 mg daily with a goal of losing at least 5 lbs of fluid. Will start spironolactone 12.5 mg daily as well. Will get an echocardiogram as well to evaluate for pulmonary hypertension and valvular disease. Encouraged her to change to a low salt diet and to restrict fluid to 2L a day.

2. Neurohormonal blockade: Start spironolactone as above. Continue metoprolol 25 mg daily. Its possible that her cough is related to her ACE-I. Will d/c lisinopril and start losartan 12.5 mg daily. Check labs 12/24 including BNP.

Transient ischemic attack . - She reportedly had a TIA earlier. She has been on plavix. She has had an altered mental status periodically. I have asked her to see a neurologist here at MGH.

HPI: Mr. Grover is a 64M with non-ischemic CM (EF 32%), chronic LBBB, and atrial fibrillation on warfarin who is admitted to the SDU today for monitoring after placement of a biventricular pacer/ICD. Pt was diagnosed with a LBBB 25 years ago and with atrial fibrillation 2 years ago. He states that he is asymptomatic with atrial fibrillation, though prior notes suggest that he has previously experienced rapid palpitations. Since that time he has had several more episodes of AF, some of which resolved spontenously in a few hours. He was started on anticoagulation and flecainide in 2012, which was then transitioned to Multaq. AF persisted, despite antiarrhythmic therapy, thus this was discontinued, and he has been managed with rate control since that time.  


During his initial admission for new onset AF, pt was also diagnosed with CHF with EF 40% on tTE and 30% by LVgram on cath. Cors were clean at that time. Most recent TTE in Feb 2014 revealed EF 31%. Pt denies any recent CP, palpitations, dyspnea, lightheadedness, syncope, vision change, focal weakness, f/c, dysuria, and n/v/d.  


Pt is admitted today following placement of biventricular pacer/ICD (CRT) given LBBB in hopes of improving HF symptoms. Procedure was done with axillary access. LV lead was placed via the coronary sinus. Device was set to act on HR>200. Mode is set to VVTR. Pt tolerated the procedure well.

 Interval History:
 May 14th, 2014

Problem List
1. Atrial fibrillation -- persistent. CHADS2 score of 2 for hypertension and cardiomyopathy. He is appropriately on anticoagulation. 
2. History of left bundle branch block diagnosed 25 to 30 years ago. 
3. Hypertension. 
4. LVH. LVEF 32% (02/06/2014 echo)
5. Dilated aortic root (8/20/2013 echo)

We had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Terry Grover in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic today for his persistent AF and issues with cardiomyopathy. For the sake of our records we will review his past medical history 

Mr. Grover was first told he had a left bundle branch block 25 to 30 years ago with no other cardiac pathology. In August 2011, his mother had a traumatic head injury and this resulted in significant family strife. It was in this setting he developed atrial fibrillation for the first time. He describes his symptoms of atrial fibrillation as his heart beating very rapidly, erratically and feeling like it is "going to pound right out of his chest." He states he did not realize what was happening the first time he experienced these symptoms and went to the emergency room. He states as he got to the emergency room and got out of the car to walk to the emergency room, he started to feel symptoms of chest discomfort, shortness of breath and lightheadedness. When he got to the ER, he was found to be in atrial fibrillation. He spontaneously converted without intervention in approximately 3 hours. During this hospitalization, he had a transthoracic echo, which showed an ejection fraction of 40% and left ventricular hypertrophy. He had a cardiac catheterization, which was reported as showing an LVEF of 30% by ventriculography, but nonobstructive coronary artery disease. He was discharged home without intervention. He states he had three more episodes of atrial fibrillation during August and September 2011. Again, all of these lasted 3-4 hours and resolved spontaneously. His arrhythmia settled down for several months and in January 2012, he was evaluated by his local cardiologist who felt that given his CHADS2 score of 2 for cardiomyopathy and hypertension, he should be started on anticoagulation. Very sadly on February 28, 2012, his son-in-law died suddenly. He states between February 29 and March 20, he had six episodes of atrial fibrillation. He went to his local emergency room with all of these episodes and starting in February they began treating his arrhythmia with "pill-in-the-pocket" flecainide. This was effective at converting him back to sinus rhythm within 1 hour of taking the medication. 

On March 20, he saw Dr. Quinn, his local cardiologist, who started him on daily flecainide. He was initially started on 50 mg twice a day, however, after taking his first dose of 50 mg, he had atrial fibrillation several hours later and at that point his dose was increased to 100 mg twice a day. He did not have any episodes of atrial fibrillation between March 21 and April 4, 2012. Given LVH on echo, he was then transitioned from flecainide to Multaq. He then soon developed persistent AF on Multaq, and was hospitalized at Cooley Dickinson Hospital 6/4-6/5/2012 with AF/RVR. Multaq was stopped given persistent AF on Multaq and the results of the PALLAS study, and he has been treated with rate control. More recently, his AF rates have been better controlled (home pulse checked frequently, range 60s-80s bpm). Despite better rate control, he feels that his energy is less at times but has stabilized, His exertional tolerance is worse in AF but he is attempting to adapt. 

He then went to the ER at Cooley Dickinson Hospital on 7/11/2013 with dyspnea, and was felt to be volume overloaded and was diuresed and sent home. He then re-presented with further dyspnea to Cooley Dickinson Hospital on 8/13/2013, and was admitted from 8/13-8/15/2013. An echo there showed LVEF 30%. He was started on aspirin and lipitorand his lasix from increased from 20 to 40 mg daily, his lisinopril was increased from 10 to 20 mg daily, and aldactone 25 mg daily was added. Since discharge on 8/15/2013, his dypnea and energy have been much better.

MGH Echo 02/06/14: LVEF 31% with dilated LV (prior LVEF 52% April 2012), dilated and diffusely hypokinetic RV, LA 49 mm, trace-mild valvular abnormalities, small posterior pericardial effusion, dilated aortic root.

As as result we had discussed possible ablation for return to NSR versus leaving him in AF and pursuing a BiV-ICD for improved HF symptoms and return to pre-disease state.

He has issues with fatigue and DOE but ok at rest. He has had no issues with chest pain. fever, chills, palpitations. orthopnea or associated issues

 Past medical history:
 1. Atrial fibrillation -- persistent. CHADS2 score of 2 for hypertension and cardiomyopathy. He is appropriately on anticoagulation. 
2. History of left bundle branch block diagnosed 25 to 30 years ago. 
3. Hypertension. 
4. LVH. LVEF 32% (02/06/2014 echo)
5. Dilated aortic root (8/20/2013 echo)

Assessment and Plan: 

Cardiomyopathy . - A recent ECHO showed that he has an EF of 32%. He still has issues with DOE and has scaled his activity way back. We discussed further options for him. At this time a CRT-D device has been offered to him. He has persistent AF and it may be difficult to restore NSR which will possibly complicate the effectiveness of the BiV pacing as his rate may be too fast at times. In most cases research shows that patients with persistent to chronic AF due better with biV pacing after an AV nodal ablation. This is an option once his device is in and has time to get settked. We want to avoid any possible complications with device in the initial stages as a being pacemaker dependent would pose significant problems He also has at least NY heart classification stage 2 and ongoing low EF that warrants primary prevention from sudden death with an ICD implant as well. 

The risks were explained and include, bleeding, infection, stroke, heart attack, tamponade. He understands and would like to proceed with the device implant. We has been set him up for early May and his work-up has been without issue

 Reason for visit:
 Admission to Ellison 11.

 Interval History:
 79 yo female with prior medical history of CAD, Cardiomyopathy, COPD, tobacco abuse admitted to Melrose Wakefield Hospital via ER on 12/16/11 with progressive SOB. She was found to be in new atrial fibrillation and CHF. Patient is followed by Dr. Bruce Watrous. Information was obtained from hospital discharge summary and patient interview.

Cardiac history is as follows:
2005 cath- 60% mid RCA, EF 30-35%
3/11 TTE EF 20-25%
Since 4/11 has had intermittent orthopnea and PND.
9/11 TTE EF <20%

This past month patient reports worsening dyspnea, orthopnea and PND, with pattern of sleeping for 20 minutes then awakening unable to breathe and having to sit up for at least 2 hours for it to resolve. She used Atrovent MDI which helped somewhat. She denies complaints of chest pain, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, palapatations, fever, chills, productive cough, or peripheral edema. She contacted her physician, Dr. Watrous and was started on Toprol XL 12/14/11 and scheduled for an clinic appointment on 12/22/12. She continued to have frequent episodes of SOB and on 12/16/11 felt her breathing so difficult that she called 911 and was brought to ED at Melrose Wakefield Hospital. On admission she was noted to be in a new onset atrial fibrillation and CHF on exam and by CXR. By report, she was diuresed with IV Lasix - unclear how much IV Lasix given- and her ventricular rate was controlled with beta blockers and Digoxin. Per pt, her weight has decreased from 133 to 127 lbs. since admit. Her orthopnea and PND resolved and she has persistent DOE with amb to BR. Asymptomatic runs NSVT noted. 

On 12/21/11 Cardiac cath revealed large RCA with ostial 60-70% and "platelike" 90% mid stenoses. LV gram EF "in the range of 10%, give or take 5%".Patient is transferred for planned RCA PCI as well as further management of her atrial fibrillation and consideration of a an ICD, ? timing. 

At this time, patient is NPO for planned return to cath lab for RCA PCI.

Note: There is an addendum for this note (12/23/2011) 

 Reason for visit:
 Cardiology NP admission note. Referred from Dr. Bruce Watrous for consideration of RCA PCI and EP evaluation. 

 Interval History:
 PCP/Cardiologist Dr. Bruce Watrous

Pt. denies any signs of angina, other than dyspnea which was chronic DOE. She has chronic LBBB and NSVT. 
2005 cath- 60% mid RCA, EF 30-35%
3/11 TTE EF 20-25%
Since 4/11 has had intermittent orthopnea and PND.
9/11 TTE EF <20% (no mention of valvular disease, RV or RVSP- await fax of this from Dr. Watrous office). 
Past 3-4 wks, worsening dyspnea, orthopnea and PND, with pattern of sleeping for 20 minutes then awakening unable to breathe and having to sit up for at least 2 hours for it to resolve. She quit smoking. Cough was loose and nonproductive. She tried Ativan which did not help, Atrovent MDI which helped somewhat. She kept "trying to wait until my appt. with Dr. Watrous" on 12/22). On 12/14, Toprol was added. She continued to have frequent episodes dyspnea. She denied any palpitations or dizziness. 
12/16 Called 911 and brought to ED at Melrose Wakefield Hospital with SOB. Af rate 90-100's with stable BP. NT pro BNP 17914. Ruled out for MI with CK 44, 64 and Troponin T 0.01 X 2. Digoxin 0.5 mg then 0.25 mg IV given. PA/lat CXR worsening interstitial lung markings ?edema vs. worsening pulm fibrosis. Unchanged cardiomegaly. Diuresed- unclear how much IV Lasix given. Per pt, weight has decreased from 133 to 127 lbs. since admit; per notes wt was 126.4 on 12/19 and 126.2 lbs. on 12/20. Her orthopnea and PND resolved and she has persistent DOE with amb to BR. Asymptomatic runs NSVT noted and remained in A fib- Lovenox started (held for cath). 12/18 Strips of 4 and 5 beat runs WCT, irregular with rate 180-220 sent, and 25 beat run irregular WCT rate 180-190's. RN notes indicate 4 episodes NSVT 10-13 beats while pt. sleeping. Lowest rate noted in 50's. Cough noted to be productive of yellow sputum. 
12/21 Cath (per Dr. Watrous note; per cath lab not yet dictated by Dr. Watrous- await call back from him re. amt. dye given and ?RHC) revealed large RCA with ostial 60-70% and "platelike" 90% mid stenoses; per our review also 40% prox and mid LAD. LV gram EF "in the range of 10%, give or take 5%". Amount dye given not noted. Dr. Watrous planned "anticoagulation for 4-6 weeks for the possibility of cardioversion later" and desired additional input re. optimal timing of ICD. Pt. amenable to having PCI +/- ICD if indicated.

 Impression:
 #1 Cardiac- 79 y.o. with cardiomyopathy and acute on chronic heart failure. 
-Ischemia- ruled out for MI. RCA lesions have progressed over past 6 yrs, but no significant left sided disease (per Dr. Baron/Drachman's review of films)- await Dr. Rosenfield's review of her anatomy and case before proceeding to RCA PCI tomorrow- keep NPO after midnight. Cardiomyopathy seems out of proportion to CAD. Unclear why not on ASA, statin. Will add ASA 325 mg daily. Add low dose statin for goal LDL <70. LFT's normalized- likely elev d/t congestion. 
-Pump- Weight and NT pro BNP and LFT's trended down with diuresis; renal function normal and initially elevated BUN now normalized. JVP remains elevated but able to lie flat; will obtain RHC along with cors also given pulm HTN noted in history. Will obtain most recent echo report and obtain MGH TTE to clarify valvular and RV function and further evaluate etiology of her cardiomyopathy. Unclear why not on Ace I and diuretics. Has some BP room. Isolated hyperkalemia- overall K+ nl to sl. low in setting of diuresis. Ideally would like to add Ace I and Aldactone to Lasix if BP and K+ allow. Give IV Lasix 20 mg this PM- hold in AM anticipating potential repeat dye load with PCI. Add Captopril 6.25 mg tid- hold for SBP <100. Will decide on Aldactone depending on K+ trends over next 1-2 days. Follow I/O and daily weights; 2 gm Na+ diet. 
-Rhythm- new diagnosis atrial fibrillation- EKG here looks more like flutter waves; variable response and fair rate control. Recently started on low dose BB- con't Coreg 3.125 mg bid rather than Toprol. Digoxin added this admit- will hold for now and d/w Dr. Rosenfield if wants to continue. Has not been on anticoagulation and has gotten intermittent LMWH at OSH. Will initiate IV Heparin and hold on Coumadin for now. Overall impression that optimal medical management and RCA PCI +/- cardioversion may improve her LV function, but not necessarily to the point where she is no longer an ICD candidate. Will consult EP after clarifying with Dr. Rosenfield whether TEE/DCCV desired this admit, or whether consult solely for consideration of ICD/timing. Check TSH.
Further plans per Dr. Rosenfield. Await call back from Dr. Watrous to clarify history and medical management. 
#2 Heme- HCt stable; platelet count labile but not meeting criteria to check HIT, and is now normal; con't to follow daily CBC. Check B12 given borderline anemia and macrocytosis. Guaiac all stools. 
#3 Pulm- con't Spiriva with Atrovent prn. Consult smoking cessation. 

Attending Admission Note
12/22/11
7 PM
I confirmed the history of present illness, PMH, medications, and ROS. I also confirmed the cardiovascular examination and interpreted the pertinent laboratory data. I discussed findings with the patient and developed the management strategy. My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above. 
Will get EP and HT Failure services to evaluate and also will recheck echo here. Will need to make decision re: pci.
More to follow after input from consultants and review of films.

Addendum: 12/23/2011
12/23/11
11 AM
1) Films reviewed- RCA has serial lesions in large vessel- 70% prox and 75-80% mid. LCA non-obstructive. EF 15%.
2) Spoke with EP. They would like Med Rx for control of EF and CHF for 3 months before placing ICD.
3) Dr. Watrous feels quite strongly that her severe RCA disease places her at signf risk of ischemic event. 

We will proceed with cath, possible PCI (Pressure-wire RCA to confirm hemod. signif, though pretty clear about that). HIgh risk, so will do with IAB support.

Pt agrees.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

Dear Rory and Paul,

 I had the pleasure to see your patient, Richard Millea, today in the cardiac arrhythmia clinic for his history of NICM with LBBB.

Echo evaluation of LV function has included the following:
7/15/2014: LVEF 23%
3/4/2013: LVEF 21%
9/6/2012: LVEF 22%

------------------

Detailed cardiac history per Dr. Weiner

The patient is a 68-year-old man with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (based on CT-A), non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, LBBB, prostate cancer, and colon cancer who returns for follow up. I initally met him in outpatient consultation in Sepetember 2011.

As a review, LBBB present for a number of years. TTE in August 2011 reports LVEF 25-30%. LVIDd 54 mm. Trace MR. LA 40 mm anterior-posterior. No AS/AI. Trace TR, estimated RVSP 21 mmHg. 

For evaluation of LV systolic dysfunction, coronary CT-A in September 2011 revealed partially calcified plaque in the proximal and mid LAD (mild stenosis). Other coronaries had no evidence of plaque/stenosis. He was started on a low-dose ACE inhibitor. He had successful prostate surgery in NY in November 2011 (first attempt was complicated by bradycardia during abdominal insufflation). 

Screening colonoscopy in June 2012 showed large sigmoid mass consistent with invasive adenocarcinoma. He underwemt low anterior resection and primary anastamosis in July 2012 and FOLFOX adjuvant chemotherapy. 

TTE in September 2012 showed LVEF 22%, LVIDd 58 mm. Trace MR. LA 40 mm anterior-posterior. No AS. Trace AI. Trace TR, estimated RVSP 35 mmHg. Normal RV size and function.

TTE in March 2013 to reassess LVEF for ICD candidacy showed LVEF 21%, LVIDd 62 mm. Trace MR. Trace TR, estimated RVSP 34 mmHg. Normal RV size and function.

I last saw him in October 2013. He was seen by Oncology in April 2014 and chest CT showed stable pulmonary nodules. He went to Peru in Feb. 2014 for a wedding reception for his son. He walked/hiked at altitude and felt well. His daughter-in-law is expecting a baby in July.

He feels well. He continues to walk 1 mile most days. He can have foot pain from neuropathy, otherwise no limitations. He also does activities around the house and starting working 4 hrs/day at a friend's auto supply shop to help him keep busy.

He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope. No lower extremity swelling, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

 EKG:
 Sinus bradycardia at 59 bpm. LBBB. PR 152, QRS 156, QTc 487 ms.

Assessment and Plan: 
68-year-old man with nonobstructive coronary artery disease, nonischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 20-25%), hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer, and colon cancer.

Cardiomyopathy - Echo evaluation of LV function has included the following:
7/15/2014: LVEF 23%
3/4/2013: LVEF 21%
9/6/2012: LVEF 22%

He has non-ischemic cardiomypathy, a LBBB and NYHA class I-II CHF. He meets criteria for CRT-ICD implant based on the MADIT-CRT study.

Of note, he has not been treated with beta blockers due to his bradycardia, but these could likely be initiated if he has a CRT device implanted. He was treated with lisinopril in the past, but this did not improve his LVEF and so was stopped.

I spoke to him at length about the risks and benefits of CRT-ICD implant. We discussed benefits which include the possibility of a reduction in CHF development over time and in mortality. We also discussed the possibility of implant of either a CRT-pacemaker or non-CRT ICD, but I recommended that he have a CRT-ICD if he decides to have a device implant. We discussed procedural risks which include be are not limited to: failure to implant the device successfully, pain, bleeding, damage to the heart/lung/blood vessels, device infection, heart attack, stroke or death.

He is leaning in favor of CRT-ICD implant, but he wishes to discuss it first with his son, who is a surgical resident in New York. I told him that I would be happy to discuss this with him and his son by telephone or in the office.

Six or seven weeks ago, pt was sitting at his computer for a period of time. Upon arising, pt noted immediate and sudden onset of pain in right anteromedial aspect of his right knee (below and adjacent to patella, proximal aspect of tibia. Since then pt has noted waxing and waning sharp pain in that area, which has also been tender to palpation. Over the past several days pain has increased significantly in intensity. Pain is worst when knee is flexed at 90 deg and pt is getting up. Other positions can aggravate pain. 


Prior to onset of pain at that time, no previous history of pain with similar quality. 


Pt denies fever, chills, sweats, new onset stiffness or pain in other joints. Pt denies any prior injury to R knee. +History trauma to L knee, s/p arthroscopic surgery (cartilage debridement) of L knee several years ago (@Lahey clinic). 


+FHx cancer (lung cancer, father). 

+ prior hx melanoma (resected). 


Of note, pt has a history of cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology which began around 1yr -- 1yr and some months ago. Pt is scheduled to have an AV chamber synchronized pacemaker placed tomorrow (Thur 2/26). 


Pertinent PMH:  

Renal Failure, on dialysis (cause of renal failure unknown). 

Heart Failure, EJ frac ~20%. 

prior hx melanoma (resected). 


Hx of BPH, stable/nl PSA's. 


Physical Exam:  

? some swelling, warmth in area of pain/tenderness, most evident when knee is fully extended. No increased mobility with varus/valgus movement of lower leg. Negative anterior drawer test. 


Are of tenderness is anteromedial aspect of R knee. Areas of pain/tenderness follows a line-like pattern, with area of focal/increased tenderness. 


Studies: 


Plain films: No fractures or dislocations. Patella intact. +small interarticular bodies within joint. Degenerative changes, area of sclerosis in anterior proximal tibia (does correspond to area of pain/tenderness), suggestive of cartilage involvment vs. osteonecrosis. Suggested f/u study: MRI w gadolinium contrast (to assess for evidence of neoplasm). 


Assessment/Plan: 

R knee pain. History, area of pain and tenderness consistent with bursitis. However, correlation of area of pain with findings on x-ray, prior history melanoma (resected), need to assess for any other suggestion of neoplasm. 


Further workup complicated by fact that pt is scheduled for pacemaker placement tomorrow. Spoke with electrophysiology/arrhythmia lab -- after pacemaker placement, MRI would be contraindicated (more for possible adverse effects of MRI on pacemaker than vice versa). 


PLAN: 

1. Managed to schedule MRI with gadolinium contrast this evening at 8:15PM.  


Pt to continue with planned pacer placement tomorrow. Future f/u with PCP, orthopedic surgeon.

 Reason for visit:
 s/p CRT-D admission for Dr. Singh

 Interval History:
 Mr. Wass is a 82 year old male with a history of syncopal episode in July complicated by subsequent subarachnoid hemorrhage was found to have LVEF of 18% with left bundle branch block and NSVT. 

In November 2014 a repeat cardiac ultrasound done at outside hospital confirmed that his LV function was still low at 20% with a dilated LV. He had akinesis involving the septal, anterior, apical and inferior walls, with severe lateral hypokinesis and hypokinesis of the postero basal wall. He had bi-atrial enlargement with severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. His RV systolic pressure was 54 mmHg. 

He has been unable to tolerate any upward titration of his metoprolol or other medications because of hypotension and dizziness. He has been wearing a life vest and on 1/24/15 his life Vest documented an episode of NSVT sustained for 17 beats. 

He had a cardiac catheterization on 1/12/15 RA 9, RV 62/6 (LBBB), LV: 120/20. LAD, Cx: no flow limiting lesion, RCA: 90% + 80% stenosis. He received one long DES to his RCA. He was loaded with 600 mg of plavix. He had a right groin hematoma that remained stable overnight. Of note is that post cardiac catheterization he developed acute heart failure event requiring I be Lasix with brisk diuresis. His medications were titrated with increased dose of lasix to 40 mg QD. Overnight telemetry showed frequent PVCs and brief, asymptomatic NSVT. Outpatient diuretic increased to 40 mg daily. Plan is now to have his CRT- D placed on Friday. He continues with NYHA class III symptoms. 

He received an CRT-D today without complication. He did not take his diuretic this morning and received 10 mg IV lasix during the case. He had a pressure dressing placed over his left chest wall device site for precaution given his dual antiplatlet therapy of ASA and plavix. 

On arrival to Ellison 11, the patient was hemodynamically stable. On interview, the patient confirmed the above mentioned symptoms shortness of breath. Cardiac review of systems is negative for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, angina, palpitations, presyncope, syncope or claudication.

 Interval History:
 Dr. Singh and I hve the pleasure of following Mr. Wass in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service clinic who will undergo admission on 1/30/2015 for CRT-D device. His history has been detailed in our prior notes but we will review recent events here. 

He is an 82-year-old gentleman with left bundle branch block and LVEF 18-25% along with QRS 154 ms and NYHA class III symptoms who after a July syncopal episode complicated by subsequent subarachnoid hemorrhage was found to have LVEF of 18% with left bundle branch block and NSVT. He has been wearing a Life Vest since we saw him last month until we could evaluate his level of ischemia as a contributory factor to his original episode. In November 2014 a repeat cardiac ultrasound done at outside hospital confirmed that his LV function was still low at 20% with a dilated LV. He had akinesis involving the septal, anterior, apical and inferior walls, with severe lateral hypokinesis and hypokinesis of the postero basal wall. He had bi-atrial enlargement with severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. His RV systolic pressure was 54 mmHg. 

He has been unable to tolerate any upward titration of his metoprolol or other medications because of hypotension and dizziness. Earlier this week his life Vest documented an episode of NSVT sustained for 17 beats.

His ischemia workup included CTA locally with minimal Left Main and Ramus disease. The LAD had multiple, partially calcified plaques with severe luminal narrowing in the mid LAD. The 1st Diagonal branch has a moderate narrowing. The Circumflex had mild proximal and mid vessel narrowing. The RCA was heavily calcified with a possible high-grade luminal narrowing proximally. The evaluation of distal RCA is limited by motion however there was a suspicion of high-grade stenosis. Viability study showed LV viable in all arterial distributions. Mild fixed inferior thinning. 

He was admitted directly to the Cath lab: RAP 9 mmHg, RVSP 62/6. LVEDP 20 mmHg. Coronary angiography revealed no flow limiting stenoses in the Left Main, LAD and Circumflex. The RCA was co-dominant with tandem 90% and 80% lesions in the distal vessel, proximal to a moderate to large PDA branch. He underwent successful stenting of the distal RCA with a 2.75mm x 38mm Promus (drug eluting) stent. Of note is that post cardiac catheterization he developed acute heart failure event requiring I be Lasix with brisk diuresis. Overnight telemetry showed frequent PVCs and brief, asymptomatic NSVT. Outpatient diuretic increased to 40 mg daily. Plan is now to have his CRT- D placed on Friday. He continues with NYHA class III symptoms.

He denies any further syncope, chest pain, palpitations or PND. He does experience dyspnea with even mild exertion, and was previously very active. He feels it is getting better. He also denies any lightheadedness and dizziness. 

His electrophysiologist is Jagmeet Singh, M.D., Ph.D and his interventional cardiology team includes IK Jang and his nurse practitioner Denise Gauthier.

 Narrative Note:
 Called Mr. Wass' wife yesterday for f/up. He is an 82 y/o male of patient of Dr. Jang's I recently saw for CHF. He has a hx of CAD s/p PCI of his RCA with decompensated CHF following procedure. Able to be d/c the next day. He had been having relatively low BPs (symptomatic, fatigued, 90s systolic) with some faster HR. In NSR when he was seen by me 1/23 with SBP 110-120s. I increased his Metoprolol from 12.5 mg daily to bid. His wife informed me that his BP has been >100, 106/72, 104/71 with pulse 77, 82. On the 24th, his Lifevest did alarm. Rate 162. Daughter sent a report to Zoll. When they did check, his pulse was 60, 103/60. 

I called Zoll today. They informed me that Mr. Wass did indeed have a brief run of VT on 1/24 at 6:30. They will fax me a copy of this run which I will scan into the system. He is s/f ICD placement on 1/30/2015. 

Lastly, TSH elevated. Ordered when I first was concerned about Afib. Not on Amiodarone. Will get repeat with T3/4 next visit (next month).

Addendum: 1/28/2015
Was a 19 beat run of VT at ~150 bpm. Faxed copy over to Dr. Singh's office so he is aware. Will call family just to ensure he wears the life vest until procedure, aside from bathing.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 First CHF post discharge clinic. Pt of Dr. Jang's. 

 Interval History:
 82 y/o male with hx of CHF (20%) with MR, TR, fall s/p ICH. Afib, CAD (dx 8/14 after fall but initially treated conservatively given bleed) presents for his first CHF discharge appointment following recent admission 1/12-13/2015 for PCI complicated by CHF.

Admitted for elective cath after cleared by Neurology for anticoagulation following ICH. CTA locally with minimal Left Main and Ramus disease. The LAD had multiple, partially calcified plaques with severe luminal narrowing in the mid LAD. The 1st Diagonal branch has a moderate narrowing. The Circumflex had mild proximal and mid vessel narrowing. The RCA was heavily calcified with a possible high-grade luminal narrowing proximally. The evaluation of distal RCA is limited by motion however there was a suspicion of high-grade stenosis. Viability study showed LV viable in all arterial distributions. Mild fixed inferior thinning. 
He was admitted directly to the Cath lab: RAP 9 mmHg, RVSP 62/6. LVEDP 20 mmHg. Coronary angiography revealed no flow limiting stenoses in the Left Main, LAD and Circumflex. The RCA was co-dominant with tandem 90% and 80% lesions in the distal vessel, proximal to a moderate to large PDA branch. He underwent successful stenting of the distal RCA with a 2.75mm x 38mm Promus
(drug eluting) stent. 
Post procedure pt developed ADHF. He was treated with IV Lasix with Brisk diuresis. Overnight telemetry showed frequent PVCs and brief, asymptomatic NSVT. Outpatient diuretic increased to 40 mg daily. Plan is now for CRT-D on 1/28/2015. 

TODAY:
Accompanied by daughter and wife. 

Prior to recent admission. SBP 110-120s for the most part and 70s. Daughter states it has always been irregular and, while he has had a hx of Afib, he had not recently been in Afib. Lisinopril stopped a day or so after d/c and Lasix reduced from 40 mg to 20 mg daily for low BPs (felt lethargic and out of it when 90s/50s). Metoprolol lowered 1/16/2015 for ongoing low BP. BPs 99/52, 112/61, 126/78, 97/59, 117/88, 96/65, 95/59. Starting 2 days ago, HR jumped up to low 90s. High was 115. They are wondering why. Denies sensing any irregular or fast heart beats. No dizziness. Family states when diastolic in 50s, he is more drowsy. 

He is presently wearing the lifevest and plan is for ICD implantation next Wednesday. With faster HR, daughter did hit a record button on his Lifevest. Is wondering if this recorded anything. 

Watching weight daily. Pre MI was 160 lbs. Very active. Shoveled. Raised money for his church. Post MI, illness, got down to 132 lbs. Now dry weight, per family, 155 lbs. Yesterday was 156 lbs with pants and lifevest on. Weighed today w/out lifevest and 157 lbs. Last night had a lobster meal. Only ate the tail. States he has not yet learned about diet. Did not know NA restriction. Eats instant oatmeal in the AM. Once a week has a burger and cheese (american). No significant LE edema - wearing compression stockings. No abd bloating but bothered by abdominal hernia. Contributes to limited mobility. Wife states that, when he gains fluid, he typically begins to develop a dry cough. She will give him an additional PO Lasix for this. No orthopnea (2 pillows), No PND. Prior to PCI would get OOB after showering. Now much easier although felt a little out of breath after his shower today. 

No falls, dizziness, syncope since LOC in July. No recurrent seizures. Was using a walker, then a cane. Now does not need to walk with an assistive device. No hx of CVA. 

No bld in urine/stool/nosebleeds. 

Is beginning to have minor recollections from the day he lost conciousness. Recalls waking up on a cement floor and having trouble getting up. 

Has new PCP in Nashua - Dr. Siroty. Asks that all information be sent to him. Currently living with daughter.

Assessment and Plan: 
Mr. Wass is a 82 year old male with a history of iCM with LVEF 18%, ICH s/p fall, CAD s/p RCA last week with post procedure acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation. Here for his first CHF post discharge appointment.

Cardiomyopathy .. - Found to have significant systolic dfxn at the time of his MI/Syncopal episode this past summer. CTA suggestive of significant CAD so likely felt to be ischemia. However recent cath revealed only significant disease in his RCA. Reduced EF out of proportion to disease. No significant valve disease and no hx of HTN. ECG w/LBBB but no low voltage or significantly thick walls on TTE to suggest an infiltrative disease like amyloid. TSH ordered today. May benefit from further evaluation to r/out causes (SPEP/UPEP, iron studies, thiamine to name a few). From a failure standpoint, seems to be doing fairly well. Family appropriately adjusting diuretic (first manifestation of hypervolemia is a cough), following weight. Currently not on lisinopril for symptomatic hypotension. Metoprolol dose recently reduced but HR increased (addressed below). Will try and titrate back up in divided doses - 12.5 mg bid. Will hold on adding back lisinopril for now. As volume status reasonable today, won't adjust diuretic but encouraged family to take addl 20 mg of Lasix if wt >2 lbs overnight, 5 lbs in a week or if he is trending up and develops his cough. Spend a fair amount of time on diet as pt did not know of appropriate CHF diet and was eating all the wrong things. 2 grams, 2L restrictions reviewed. Wearing Lifevest. ICD implantation planned for next week. 

Atrial fibrillation .. - No confirmed afib but documented in history (? on an ECG that is no longer accessible in system). Recent increase in HR from 70s-90/100s (home monitoring) concerning for afib, but, today, in NSR with freq PVCs. ?Reduction in metoprolol a cause for this rise - although really modest change so I would not think this would account for increase. No e/o failure, no signs or symptoms of bleeding. Called Zoll and recordings daughter made were actually not recorded. Spoke to rep and only recordings made will be if high rates >150 detected. I typically would consider getting a 24 or 48 hour monitor for further evaluation, but, by the time I acquire this, pt will have had his ICD in place. Will hold on additional monitoring for now and await ICD and response to higher bblocker. 

Ischemic heart disease .. - Last July he most likely had an ischemic event which precipitating syncope/fall-->ICH. Given ok to start ASA and Clopidogrel by Neurology. Found to have only significant CAD in RCA last week. S/p DES, 2.75mm x 38mm Promus, to his distal RCA. Tolerating ASA, Clopidogrel. On high dose Atorvastatin 80 mg daily. Also on bblocker (s/p MI). LBBB on ECG. No new changes today. F/up next month with Dr. Jang. Has Nitro for prn use. 

Habits/Risk Screening: 
Smoking status: never smoked 

 DX Tests Ordered:
 CMP, CBC, TSH, BNP. 

Disposition:
RTC on 2/19/2015, when he is scheduled to see Dr. Jang. Will f/up by phone in interim given distance. 

 Education/Counselling:
 >50% of today's visit devoted to education and coordination of care.

 Narrative Note:
 I received a phone call from Mr. Wass' wife. She reports she was told to call me from "Shelby" who the RN. This is a patient I have not yet seen (nor have reviewed his chart/history). On cursory review, he is an 82 y/o male with hx of CM s/p recent PCI to his RCA here who had ADHF after cath. He was only admitted overnight. She states his BP is typically 117/67. His weight was 154.9 yesterday and 154.2 today and she believes this is his dry weight. At last PCP appt was 155 lbs. She will hold his lisinopril if his SBP is in the low 90s/diastolic 50 or lower. Last night he was 99/55 so they held the lisinopril. He was not lightheaded but a bit "out of it". He had been this way in the past when metoprolol was uptitrated. He typically had been on Furosemide 20 mg daily, but had been increased to 40 mg daily upon d/c. She is wondering for how long and if he should continue on this dose. She is also wondering if she can divide the dose. She only gave him 20 mg this AM.

Unfortunately, as I have not yet met this man, I am limited in what I can recommend. I explained that diuretic dosing can be very variable. She can divide the dose in half to 20 mg bid. Instructed her she should ensure there are 6 hours between the doses. We do have an appointment on 1/23/2015 in which case I can determine his diuretic dosing. He will get labs on 1/16/2015. Results to go to Dr. Jang. I will try and obtain those, but may repeat labs again on 1/23.

 Narrative Note:
 Patient evaluated in detail. Findings of cath and intervention noted. 
Degree of disease not commensurate with extent of LV dysfunction. The likelihood of LVEF improvement after PCI is low, hence will proceed with CRT-D within the next 2-4 weeks. Patient having a significant amount of NSVT and is till with LifeVest on. I have discussed wthis with the patient and my team. We are all in agreement that a CRT-D would be the next best option.

 Reason for visit:
 s/p RCA stent admission for Dr. Jang

 Interval History:
 Interval history taken from NP Dejoseph's admission note and interview. 

He was in his usual state of health without a prior cardiac history until last summer. He had an out of hospital syncopal episode hitting his head resulting in an intracranial hemorrhage. At that time he was noted to have a LBBB on his ECG. His troponin's were elevated, however, cardiac catheterization was not undertaken given his cerebral bleed and inability to give anti-platelet or anticoagulation therapy. His ejection fraction at that time was reportedly 18-25%. he had one episode of NSVT during that admission. The plan was for a repeat echocardiogram in two months and cardiac catheterization when he could be safely anticoagulated. of note, there was a question of atrial fibrillation on an ECG from August 9th (but that is no longer in the system). 

He was discharged home but was subsequently admitted to MGH in August following a seizure at home. A head MRI/MRA revealed bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, left greater than right. Hemorrhagic contusions were seen within the left frontal lobe, left parietal, and right frontal lobe with associated edema. He also had contusion involving the left inferior parietal lobule/supra marginal gyrus with significant edema within the cortex and subjacent white matter. Small contusion was seen within the left inferior temporal lobe with associated edema. He also had a layering hemorrhage within the ventricles, right greater than left. There are small bilateral subdural collections. He again had elevated troponin's but given his extensive intracranial hemorrhage, it was felt not safe to proceed with cardiac catheterization. An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 18% with diffuse hypokinesis but no LV thrombus or valvular disease. He was managed medically at that time. 

In November he had a follow up echocardiogram at St. Joseph's Hospital. His ejection fraction was less than 20% with a dilated LV. He had akinesis involving the septal, anterior, apical and inferior walls, with severe lateral hypokinesis and hypokinesis of the postero basal wall. He had bi-atrial enlargement with severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. His RV systolic pressure was 54 mmHg. 

Neurologically, he is doing much better at this point. He denies any further syncope, palpitations or PND. He does experience dyspnea with even mild exertion, and was previously very active. He feels it is getting better. He also denies any lightheadedness and dizziness. His G tube has been removed and he is eating on his own. His aphasia has also improved, still have medications with apple sauce. His most recent head CT in late September revealed resolution of intraparenchymal, subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhages. He is followed by Dr. Silverman who has given clearance for aspirin and Plavix at this point. 

He was recently evaluated for an ICD by Dr. Singh. He underwent a cardiac CTA in December which revealed minimal Left Main and Ramus disease. The LAD had multiple, partially calcified plaques with severe luminal narrowing in the mid LAD. The 1st Diagonal branch has a moderate narrowing. The Circumflex had mild proximal and mid vessel narrowing. The RCA was heavily calcified with a possible high-grade luminal narrowing proximally. The evaluation of distal RCA is limited 
by motion however there was a suspicion of high-grade stenosis. 

He also underwent a thallium viability study. The left ventricle appeared viable in all arterial distributions. There was mild fixed inferior thinning that could represent a small scar. At this point, he is much improved but not back at baseline. His gait is slow and he fatigues easily. 

Given his myocardial viability, he is admitted for cardiac catheterization and possible percutaneous intervention prior to proceeding with an ICD. RA 9, RV 62/6 (LBBB), LV: 120/20. LAD, Cx: no flow limiting lesion, RCA: 90% + 80% stenosis. He received one long DES to his RCA. He was loaded with 600 mg of plavix. He had a right femoral arterial site that was angiosealed and 7FV remained in place with a hematoma around it. ACT was drawn in CCL and he was sent to Ellsion 11 for further management. 

On arrival to Ellison 11 he had a right groin hematoma. Pressure was held for 20 minutes with resolution of the hematoma.On interview, the patient confirmed the above mentioned symptoms of tightness across chest lasting for seconds about once a week with no associated symptoms. Cardiac review of systems is negative for orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations or claudication. 

He notes to have a a dry cough for over one month, possilby related to starting lisinopril. He continued to cough resulting in right groin expanding a second time with pressure held resulting in groin becoming puffy and soft. His blood pressure became slightly elevated to 150's/90's, HR in 90-100's, crackles/wheezes in bilateral lungs, oxygen saturation 87 on RA and increased to 97 on 2L. He took his home lasix this morning. Received 400 cc of fluid and 150 cc of dye. Post cath fluids decreased to 50 cc/hr and he received 20 mg IV lasix with good result. 

Of note he has a lifevest in his closet.

Note: There is an addendum for this note (1/12/2015) 

 Reason for visit:
 Mr. Wass is an 82 year old male with recently diagnosed cardiomyopathy, admitted for cardiac catheterization an possible percutaneous intervention.

 Interval History:
 He was in his usual state of health without a prior cardiac history until last summer. He had an out of hospital syncopal episode hitting his head resulting in an intracranial hemorrhage. At that time he was noted to have a LBBB on his ECG. His troponin's were elevated, however, cardiac catheterization was not undertaken given his cerebral bleed and inability to give anti-platelet or anticoagulation therapy. His ejection fraction at that time was reportedly 18-25%. he had one episode of NSVT during that admission. The plan was for a repeat echocardiogram in two months and cardiac catheterization when he could be safely anticoagulated. of note, there was a question of atrial fibrillation on an ECG from August 9th (but that is no longer in the system). 

He was discharged home but was subsequently admitted to MGH in August following a seizure at home. A head MRI/MRA revealed bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, left greater than right. Hemorrhagic contusions were seen within the left frontal lobe, left parietal, and right frontal lobe with associated edema. He also had contusion involving the left inferior parietal lobule/supra marginal gyrus with significant edema within the cortex and subjacent white matter. Small contusion was seen within the left inferior temporal lobe with associated edema. He also had a layering hemorrhage within the ventricles, right greater than left. There are small bilateral subdural collections. He again had elevated troponin's but given his extensive intracranial hemorrhage, it was felt not safe to proceed with cardiac catheterization. An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 18% with diffuse hypokinesis but no LV thrombus or valvular disease. He was managed medically at that time. 

In November he had a follow up echocardiogram at St. Joseph's Hospital. His ejection fraction was less than 20% with a dilated LV. He had akinesis involving the septal, anterior, apical and inferior walls, with severe lateral hypokinesis and hypokinesis of the postero basal wall. He had bi-atrial enlargement with severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. His RV systolic pressure was 54 mmHg. 

Neurologically, he is doing much better at this point. He denies any further syncope, chest pain, palpitations or PND. He does experience dyspnea with even mild exertion, and was previously very active. He feels it is getting better. He also denies any lightheadedness and dizziness. His G tube has been removed and he is eating on his own. His aphasia has also improved. His most recent head CT in late September revealed resolution of intraparenchymal, subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhages. He is followed by Dr. Silverman who has given clearance for aspirin and Plavix at this point. 

He was recently evaluated for an ICD by Dr. Singh. He underwent a cardiac CTA in December which revealed minimal Left Main and Ramus disease. The LAD had multiple, partially calcified plaques with severe luminal narrowing in the mid LAD. The 1st Diagonal branch has a moderate narrowing. The Circumflex had mild proximal and mid vessel narrowing. The RCA was heavily calcified with a possible high-grade luminal narrowing proximally. The evaluation of distal RCA is limited 
by motion however there was a suspicion of high-grade stenosis. 

He also underwent a thallium viability study. The left ventricle appeared viable in all arterial distributions. There was mild fixed inferior thinning that could represent a small scar. At this point, he is much improved but not back at baseline. His gait is slow and he fatigues easily. 

Given his myocardial viability, he is admitted for cardiac catheterization and possible percutaneous intervention prior to proceeding with an ICD.

Mr. Wass' wife called to discuss need to continue Keppra, which he continues to take at 1g BID after traumatic hemorrhagic contusions with associated SAH, SDH and IVH, complicated by seizures. He is tolerating Keppra without side effects, and there is no cardiac contraindication to continue this mediation, per cardiology. He is planned for cardiac catheterization next week, with possible AICD in the future. Given that he is tolerating Keppra well and his upcoming hospitalizations and procedures could theoretically lower his seizure threshold, will continue Keppra for now. Mrs. Wass will schedule neurology follow-up after upcoming procedures, in the next 1-2 months, at which point we will reassess the need for further AEDs.

 Narrative Note:
 Results of cardiac CTA are as follows:
 LM: The left main coronary artery has partially calcified plaque with 
 mild luminal narrowing. The LM trifurcates into LAD, LCx and ramus 
 intemedius. The ramus intermedius demonstrates no significant 
 stenosis or plaque. 

 LAD: The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) has multiple 
 partially calcified plaques with severe luminal narrowing in the mid 
 segment. Two patent diagonal (D) branches are identified. D1 has at 
 least moderate luminal narrowing at the ostium.The distal LAD wraps 
 around the apex. 

 LCx: The left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) has partially 
 calcified plaque with mild proximal and mid luminal narrowing. Two 
 patent obtuse marginal (OM) branches are identified.

 RCA: The right coronary artery (RCA) has heavily calcified and 
 noncalcified plaques with possible high-grade luminal narrowing 
 proximally. The evaluation of distal segment of RCA is limited 
 secondary to motion however there is a suspicion of high-grade 
 stenosis.
 The posterior descending artery (PDA) and the posterior left 
 ventricular (PLV) branches originate from the RCA.

 CALCIUM SCORE : The observed Agatston Calcium Score of 1358 is at 
 percentile 80% for subjects of the same age, gender, and 
 race/ethnicity who are free of clinical cardiovascular disease and 
 treated diabetes. The Agatston score for each vessel is as follows:
 LM: 41; LCx: 8; LAD: 716; RCA: 593

Reviewed with Dr. Singh and Dena DeJoseph NP for Dr. Jang and we will plan on obtaining a viability study on 12/29/14. Once we obtain these results we will determine whether to proceed with cardiac catheterization and possible intervention versus just a CRT-D implantation.

This was reviewed with the patient and his family by phone.

Note: There is an addendum for this note (1/6/2015) 

 Reason for visit:
 Cardiac Arrhythmia Service initial evaluation

 Interval History:
 Dr. Singh and I had the pleasure of meeting with Mr. Wass today in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service clinic who is accompanied by his family to today's visit. 

He is an 82-year-old gentleman with left bundle branch block and LVEF 18-25% along with QRS 154 ms and NYHA class III symptoms here to discuss CRT implantation. His cardiovascular issues began last July when he had an out of hospital syncopal episode hitting his head w subsequent subarachnoid hemorrhage. At the time he was unable to tolerate anticoagulation or Plavix so no ischemic workup was obtained. He had elevated troponin levels along with one episode of NSVT in the EW and new LBBB. He was later transferred to MGH and at that time was thought to not be a surgical candidate so no cardiac catheterization was done 

In November he had a follow up cardiac ultrasound showing continued LV dysfunction and dilated parameters. Report is available and has been scanned into on-call. 

He is now medically doing much better and his repeat echo next into our system completed at outside hospital in November shows marked LV dysfunction with LVEF 25%. His G tube is out. His daughter who is a former EMT has been carrying around a portable defibrillator and in that setting here seeking to have an ICD placed with possible CRT evaluation. 

He suffered from a fall in August, and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage and new LBBB and EF 25%. He was evaluated at an OSH and was discharged home, and then was admitted to MGH after a seizure related to previous bleed occurring July 2014. 

His story and the rising troponin's were consistent with an ischemic event in the last few weeks (likely shortly prior to his fall) that resulted in a LBBB and heart failure. TTE at the time 7/30/2014 showed an LVEF of 18%, LA 31 mm, LVIDed 45, LVIDes 42 mm with no significant valvular disease or cavity dilation. Cardiac cath was deferred at the time because of the subarachnoid hemorrhage. 

Following hospital discharge, his heart failure regimen was augmented with the addition of lisinopril and metoprolol. Overall, Mr. Wass's aphasia and general neurologic function have improved considerably. He is followed closely by Dr. Scott Silverman and was last seen on November 4, 2014. He is now walking and talking. His most recent brain CT showed interval resolution of his subarachnoid hemorrhage. Neurology is comfortable with him on aspirin 81 mg as well as the addition of Plavix at this time if he should require coronary intervention. 

There was a question of atrial fibrillation on an ECG from 8/9, that is no longer in the system. His left atrium was normal during his cardiac ultrasound. No subsequent AF was noted on the bedside monitor or ECG's during his admission. 

He denies any further syncope, chest pain, palpitations or PND. He does experience dyspnea with even mild exertion, and was previously very active. He feels it is getting better. He also denies any lightheadedness and dizziness.

 Other Data:
 TTE 8/6/14: EF 18% with diffuse hypokinesis. No LV dilation. No significant valvular disease. RVSP estimated 26 mmHg. RV with segmental dysfunction involving the apex, but normal RV systolic function. No RV dilation. 

MRI 9/29/2014:intraparenchymal, subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage as well as the subdural collections have all resolved.

 EKG:
 Sinus rhythm w frequent PVC's, LBBB, pr 184 ms, qrs 162 ms., QTc 532 ms.

Assessment and Plan: 
Mr. Wass is a lovely 82yo male who was previously independent and healthy prior to a subdural hemorrhage from a syncopal event found to have new LBBB and EF 18% thought to have had an ischemic event. He is much improved from a neurologic standpoint.

Dilated cardiomyopathy .. - Continued low LV function on optimal medications. Will obtain updated labs today. May require upwards titration of his diuretics based on results.

Atrial fibrillation .. - Will defer further evaluation for now (if given CRT-D will easily be able to determine presence of Afib). No documented episodes are present in the MGH system.

Ischemic heart disease .. - Last July he most likely had an ischemic event which precipitating these events. Per neurology, he is now safe for ASA or Plavix. We have asked him to complete an ischemia workup first including a Cardiac CT which will be completed today. From that point we will determine course of action. We have also asked him to increase his metoprolol as detailed above. Once we have confirmation of the extent of his coronary disease we will proceed with scheduling him for CRT-D implantation.

Ventricular tachycardia .. - Will arrange for Life Vest placement today to help alleviate anxiety as they are carrying around a defibrillator.

Left bundle branch block ...
Premature ventricular contraction .. - Present on his ECG- will try to increase his metoprolol with an additional 12.5 mg in the PM.

Patient Name: Joseph Innocent 

MRN: 4071156 

Date of Admission: 10/5/10 

Attending: Singh 

Admitting Resident: Sarah Turbett, M.D. 


Reason for Admission: BiV ICD placement 


HPI: 

55M PMH non-ischemic CMP with EF of 16% in 9/10 with single lead ICD placed in 2005, pulmonary HTN, DVT s/p LLE angiography and embolectomy, anxiety and depression here for BiV ICD placement. 


The patient was recently admitted with CHF exacerbation. There was no clear precipitant of the decompensation. He was successfully diuresed and his clinical symptoms resolved. The ECG showed QRS width of 126 ms, which was slightly prolonged. QRS width was 116 ms back in 2007 with gradual slow increase over the last 3 years. He has also 1st degree AV block with PR interval of 224 ms. Given this, upgrade to a BiV ICD was discussed and the patient is being admitted post procedure.  


Cath lab: BiV placer placed without issue 


Currently the patient reports some mild pain at ICD site. No chest pain, SOB, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. No diarrhea, constipation. No dizziness/lightheadedness. He is hungry.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 Bi-V ICD implant

 Interval History:
 Mr. Innocent is referred to us from Dr. Lewis for the evaluation of his CMP and consideration of CRT. He is a 55 yo man, h/o non-ischemic CMP with EF of 15%, single lead ICD placed in 2005, pulmonary HTN, DVT who was recently admitted with CHF exacerbation. There was no clear precipitant of the decompensation. He was successfully diuresed and his clinical symptoms resolved. 
The ECG showed QRS width of 126 ms, which was slightly prolonged. QRS width was 116 ms back in 2007 with gradual slow increase over the last 3 years. He has also 1st degree AV block with PR interval of 224 ms. 
He is feeling well after the recent hospitalization. He does not report any significant SOB or DOE. He does not report any PND or orthopnea. His weight has been stable around 160 lb at home. He dose report a squeezing pain in his chest when he exercises more vigorously. He does exercise regularly every day. 

 Past medical history:
 Cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic EF 15% 
Pulmonary HTN 
Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), s/p ICD placement in 2005 
Anxiety and depression 
Deep vein thrombosis, s/p left lower leg extremity angiography and embolectomy 

 Changes to Allergies 
ATORVASTATIN - reaction: elevated liver function tests [reviewed]
SPIRONOLACTONE - reaction: gyenecomastia [reviewed]
Statins - reaction: see comment (Lipitor, which presumably caused LFT elevation) [reviewed]

 Family history:
 Mother deceased at age of 58 cause heart failure, history of CM. Father is 89 years old living, history of arthritis. Siblings, 2 brothers and one sister all with history of hypertension. 2 children, daughter is 20 years old with Lupus, son is 22 and healthy. 

 Social history:
 Separated from wife and living with sister in Brockton, MA. Occupation: Was working at Data Entry at Bank of America. Has been on disability since 07-05. 

 Review of systems:
 Review of system of systems was obtained in detail and is negative except for findings from HPI.

Physical examination: 
-Pulse: 68 81
-General: No acute distress.
-Neck: JVP 6 cm. Carotids +2, no bruits
-Chest: Clear to auscultation. 
-Cardiac: Regular S1 and S2 with a prominent P2 component. Systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border, and apex. 
-Abdomen: Soft, nontender, and nondistended. No hepatomegaly. Normal bowel sounds.
-Extremities: No edema. Warm and well perfused.
-BP: 105/72

 EKG:
 7/12/2010: NSR, LAA, 1st AVB 224 ms, IVCD, QRS 126 ms, TIN in I, aVL, V5-V6 

 Assessment and plan:
 Mr. Innocent is a 55 yo man with non-ischemic CMP who is now evaluated for upgrade of his ICD to a CRT-D device. 
He had recent decompensation of CHF (NYHA III). QRS complex width has been gradually increasing over the last 3 years. He has also evidence of prolonged PR interval consistent with 1st degree AV block. 
We agree that it will be reasonable to upgrade his device to a CRT-D. We discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with Mr. Innocent and his fiancee and answered their questions, and they wish to proceed.

 Interval History:
 Office of Dr. G. Lewis

Patient showed up in the office today requesting that ALL of his prescriptions be renewed. Mr Innocent was told that this office would renew the cardiac meds but he'd have to secure the remainder of his prescriptions from PCP office. He was rather upset about this and a copy of our Prescription Renewal Line pamphlet detailing Rx renewals was provided. 

In reviewing his med list, learned that patient is on Coumadin and is not having his PT/INR's managed by any particular program or provider. 
I called his prior AMS RN, Palmie Riposa and she says that he was discharged on 10/2/09 from their program. There were compliance issues. For possible reinstatement, AMS RN is requesting that the patient reach her by telephone within the next day for possible reenrollment. Patient has been apprised of this.

Patient says he had PT/INR drawn this morning here at MGH for upcoming procedure. They are not pending as of yet. 

Mr Innocent reports that he continued having blood drawn locally at Signature Health in Brockton (508-941-7000). I called Lab for recent INR's:
INR 2.1 on 6/25/10
INR 1.6,on 5/29
INR 2.1 on 3/27.

Most Recent TTE (March 2014, Concord Cardiology): 

Normal LV cavity size and wall thickneess. Global hypokinesis. EF 26-30% with diastolic dysfunction. RV cavity size and function are normal. No significant valvular disease is noted (thickened mitral and aortic valves with trace MR, trace TR). PA pressure normal. 


Most Recent Cardiac Catheterization (may 2013) 

1. Normal filling pressures at rest. RA 6, RV 41/-1, RVEDP 9, PA  

     30/13, mean 17, PCW 10 ( 12/11) LVEDP  16 mm Hg. C.O 4.77 L/min and C.I  

     2.58. 

     2. Normal coronary arteries. 

     3. L.V is mildly dilated and globally hypokinetic. E.F is severely  

     reduced to 20 -25 %. There is no MR. 

  Dominance: Right 

     Left Main: The left main coronary artery is short, intermediate sized  

     vessel. It bifurcates into the LAD and LCX coronary arteries. Left main  

     coronary artery is normal.   

     LAD: The left anterior descending artery is moderate sized vessel,  

     which reaches the apex of the heart and gives origin to two moderate  

     sized diagonal arteries. The artery  is normal.   

     Left Circumflex: The left circumflex coronary artery is very large  

     vessel, which  gives origin to two obtuse marginal arteries. The   

     artery is normal.   

     RCA: The right coronary artery is a moderate sized vessel. The artery  

     is normal.   


Cardiac MRI June 2013: 

Normal left ventricular cavity size with moderate systolic dysfunction (LVEF = 38%). Normal RV size and function (RVEF = 53%).Mild concentric hypertrophy with a mildly increased myocardial mass index.  No abnormal late gadolinium enhancement to suggest fibrous changes, scarring, or an infiltrative process. No evidence of myocardial or hepatic iron overload.  There is a prominent accessory LV muscle bundle which attaches from the apex to the basal  

anteroseptum adjacent to the LVOT.  There does not appear to be any  

qualitative flow acceleration to suggest resting LVOT obstruction.   

Multiple liver masses which are incompletely characterized on this study, with the largest multilobulated mass measuring 7.0 x 5.4 cm in the right hepatic lobe. The differential includes focal fat,  

hemangioma, or liver neoplasm.

Primary ID Diagnosis/Diagnoses 

EColi and enterococcal bacteremia and vegetation vs. clot seen on ICD lead 


Relevant history, hospital course, ID medical decision making, and future considerations:   


66M w h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30-35%) with biV AICD placed 12/11, CAD s/p cath in 11/2009 and 9/2010, pulmonary hypertension, CKD, DM2 c/b vasculopathy and LE ulcers who presents in transfer from York Hospital with EColi and enterococcal bacteremia and vegetations seen on ICD lead. We felt that the polymicrobial nature of the bacteremia and the bacteria identified (enteric GNR + enterococcus) made a GI source far and away the most likely source of the bacteremia (not the foot). He may have had a mild diverticulitis or perhaps some ischemic colitis with gut translocation given his vascular disease. Indeed, a very likely clinical scenario given his abrupt onset of symptoms was a transient bacteremia from a GI source that caused translocation of bacteria, with the vegetation on TEE a possible chronic finding (such as a fibrinous clot) and less likely an acute formation of an infected vegetation. Nonetheless, the possibility of vegetation in the setting of bacteremia was impossible to rule-out and the patient therefore went for AICD removal on 5/23. There was no evidence of pocket infection per the EP team.  


He actually has no evidence of active infection in his L foot, let alone osteomyelitis. On my exam I could not probe to bone; at the OSH he had a negative xray including even periosteal reaction. His bone scan findings are nonspecific. It seemed very unlikely that an osteomyelitis would manifest as bacteremia without any active signs of infection in the foot itself such as erythema or drainage. Also, while diabetics can have polymicrobial infections of the foot, his flora seemed more representative of a GI source rather than what would have typically come from the foot. Vascular surgery saw him and felt there was no active infection; the pt also prefers to wait until he returns to Maine before addressing his foot issues. 


We checked an abd CT but it was actually not revealing for a particular source of infection such as abscess or diverticulitis. 


Plan is for 2 weeks of antibiotics starting on the date of AICD removal. We removed his old PICC line given that it was placed without documentation of negative blood cultures. 


Microbiology and culture source:   

EColi and amp S enterococcus from OSH cultures 

Blood, AICD lead, and urine cxs are NGTD from BWH. 


Antibiotics and Dose:  


FOR ECOLI: Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID 


FOR ENTEROCOCCUS: ampicillin 2gm IV q4h while in-hospital.  

                For home, reasonable to switch to either: 


                                Penicillin G 3million units IV q4h  

                                                                Or 

                                Linezolid 600 mg PO Q12h 


(depending on patient preference, insurance issues, etc.) 


Antibiotic Start Date:  5/23 


Anticipated Antibiotic Stop Date (contingent upon):  6/5/12 


Allergies:  NKDA 


Lab monitoring: CBC with diff, LFTs, Chem 7 at least weekly 


IV access and date inserted:  If needed, PICC can be placed as early as 5/25 (48 hrs of negative blood cultures). 


Studies related to ID consultation still pending:  none 


Copy placed into electronic medical record and chart.  Please consider reviewing this plan with patient and giving patient/family a copy of this form during your discharge teaching as well.

HPI: History as per the excellent admission note. Verified with patient: "Due to pt's CMP, he underwent implantation of a biventricular ICD in 10/2011. Pt states that he had been feeling well until one week prior to admission at York hospital on 5/16/12 when he woke up with sudden onset of chills and vomiting. Pt denied CP, SOB, abdo pain, neck pain, headache, rash, urinary symptoms. He does c/o diarrhea however felt that the diarrhea began after his admission to the hospital and after he was started on antibiotics. At York hospital, blood cultures revealed bactermia with enterococcus and e.coli. The source of the bacteremia is felt to be pt's foot ulcers. Imaging at york hospital (x-ray, bone scan) were negative for osteomyelitis. Pt was treated with unasyn and ciprofloxacin. Pt was evaluated by the cardiology, infectious disease and orthopedics services.  A PICC line was placed on 5/18/12. On 5/22/12, pt underwent a TEE which showed likely infection of at least one of the leads attached to his pacer. Pt was treated initially with unasyn and cipro and this was narrowed to ampicillin and cipro with the recommendation of starting gentamicin following lead removal. On arrival to BWH, pt denies CP, SOB, chills, sweats, abdo pain, GU symptoms. He does continue to have diarrhea. " 

Pt reports he does have orthopnea

Plan: 

- TEE to be reviewed here and uploaded onto our system 

- ID seeing for optimal Abx management, source of infection and duration of therapy (likely needs prolonged course) 

- Pt currently NPO, consented for extraction, temp wire if needed and eventual reimplant (likely needs 10-14 days prior to reimplant) 

- D/C lovenox 

- CRT-D reprogrammed to VVI 40BPM, continue to monitor to determine if any bradycardia 

- Foot Ulcer - Vascular to see for management 

- JVP to angle of jaw and orthopnea, needs optimization of CHF and diuresis, On lasix, BB, ACEI, Spironolactone, need to titrate. 


Will review with Dr. John.

Infectious Disease Inpatient Consultation   


Patient: Tilton, Gordon 

MRN: 27104629

Admit Date: 5/23/12 

Consult Date: 5/23/12 10am

Source: Pt, primary team notes 


Reason for consult: bacteremia, AICD lead vegetations 


HPI:  66M w h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30-35%) with biV AICD placed 12/11, CAD s/p cath in 11/2009 and 9/2010, pulmonary hypertension, CKD, DM2 c/b vasculopathy and LE ulcers who presents in transfer from York Hospital with EColi and enterococcal bacteremia and vegetations seen on ICD lead. The pt had been feeling well until 5/16 when he woke up with sudden onset of severe chills, vomiting, nausea, and extreme fatigue. He also noticed some vague mild abdominal pain. He presented to York Hospital. He was febrile to 101.2 and his admission labs were notable for a WBC of 8 and Cr of 2.4 (baseline Cr ~1.6). Normal AST/ALT and bili. Admission blood cx were notable for GPCs in chains and he was started on unasyn 5/17. 5/17 blood cx also showed  bottles GNR (later IDd as EColi). He had cipro PO added on 5/19 as the EColi were R to unasyn. His GPCs were confirmed to be amp S enterococcus and his unasyn was changed to amp on 5/21. He appears to have been afebrile shortly after admission there. He noted increase in his diarrhea after the onset of antibiotics, was quite watery at its worst. The providers there felt that the source of his bacteremia was his L foot, where he has chronic ulcers and vascular disease. They obtained xray which did not show bony destruction and did not even show periosteal reaction. A bone scan was then checked which showed mild uptake at the L MTP. Nevertheless there was discussion of whether he had osteomyelitis and whether he would need amputation. Of note, a PICC line was placed on 5/18 but the patient had never  had any negative blood cultures (last blood culture was the 5/17 culture which was + for EColi). On 5/22/12, pt underwent a TEE which showed likely vegetation of at least one of the leads attached to his AICD.  


On arrival to BWH, pt denies CP, SOB, cough, chills, sweats, abd pain, urinary symptoms, problems with  pocket. He does continue to have diarrhea but he reports that his stool is now more formed. He denies significant L LE pain. ROS otherwise negative.

Assessment:   

66M w h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30-35%) with biV AICD placed 12/11, CAD s/p cath in 11/2009 and 9/2010, pulmonary hypertension, CKD, DM2 c/b vasculopathy and LE ulcers who presents in transfer from York Hospital with EColi and enterococcal bacteremia and vegetations (vs. clot or fibrinous debris) seen on ICD lead. The polymicrobial nature of the bacteremia and the bacteria identified (enteric GNR + enterococcus) makes a GI source far and away the most likely source of the bacteremia (not the foot). He may have had a mild diverticulitis or perhaps some ischemic colitis with gut translocation given his vascular disease. He actually has no evidence of active infection in his L foot let alone osteomyelitis. I cannot probe to bone; he has negative xray including even periosteal reaction. His bone scan findings are nonspecific. It would be very unlikely for an osteomyelitis to manifest as bacteremia without any active signs of infection in the foot itself such as erythema or drainage. Also, while diabetics can have polymicrobial infections of the foot, I think that his flora are more representative of a GI source rather than what would have typically come from the foot. 


The PICC will need to come out given that it was placed without documentation of negative blood cultures. A new PICC can be placed after 48 hours of negative blood cultures. 


Agree that the AICD will have to be removed. Difficult to know if the mass if truly a vegetation but it is impossible to exclude this definitively. He will require approximately 2 weeks of antibiotics after AICD removal. There is no evidence that his native valves are infected. He will not need gentamicin once the AICD is out given the removal of all artificial materials; also would hesitate to use gentamicin given his renal insufficiency. 


Note that he has + CXR for ? PNA but he has no clinical evidence for PNA; regardless his current antibiotics would provide good coverage for PNA. 


Diagnostics: 

                Await admission blood cx results 

                No need for further imaging of foot given low suspicion for osteomyelitis. 

                Abd CT (O+, I- OK) to evaluate for ?diverticulitis, intrabdominal infection 


Therapeutics: 

                Agree with AICD removal. Please send clot/veg or tip for GS/culture and pathology            

Continue ampicillin 2gm IV q4h. No role for gentamicin. As an outpatient, he could potentially be switched from ampicillin to penicillin for home administration.  

                OK to continue ciprofloxacin 500 mg po q12h.  

                d/c current PICC 

                OK to place new PICC after 48 hrs of negative blood cx (i.e. 4/25). 

                Local wound care for the foot. 


Seen and discussed with Dr. Maguire. Recommendations discussed with Dr. Sheehan of the primary team and Dr. Lane from EP. We will follow.

RFA: lead vegetation 


HPI: 66yoM w h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30-35%), CAD s/p cath in 11/2009 and 9/2010, pulmonary hypertension, CKD, DM c/b vasculopathy and LE ulcers presents for ICD lead extraction 2/2 concern for vegetation on the lead. Due to pt's CMP, he underwent implantation of a biventricular ICD in 10/2011. Pt states that he had been feeling well until one week prior to admission at York hospital on 5/16/12 when he woke up with sudden onset of chills and vomiting. Pt denied CP, SOB, abdo pain, neck pain, headache, rash, urinary symptoms. He does c/o diarrhea however felt that the diarrhea began after his admission to the hospital and after he was started on antibiotics. At York hospital, blood cultures revealed bactermia with enterococcus and e.coli. The source of the bacteremia is felt to be pt's foot ulcers. Imaging at york hospital (x-ray, bone scan) were negative for osteomyelitis. Pt was treated with unasyn and ciprofloxacin. His blood pressures were initially low and it recovered and pt was resumed on his home lasix and spirinolactone. Pt was evaluated by the cardiology, infectious disease and orthopedics services.  A PICC line was placed on 5/18/12. On 5/22/12, pt underwent a TEE which showed likely infection of at least one of the leads attached to his pacer. Pt was treated initially with unasyn and cipro and this was narrowed to ampicillin and cipro with the recommendation of starting gentamicin following lead removal. On arrival to BWH, pt denies CP, SOB, chills, sweats, abdo pain, GU symptoms. He does continue to have diarrhea.

Mr. Robert Signorelli is  being admitted s/p an elective CRT-D implantation.   


HPI 

He is a pleasant 50 year-old gentleman with non-ischemic CMP (EF <26%).  His cardiac history began in 2010, when he subacutely developed fatigue, exertional dyspnea and chest discomfort, preceded by URI symptoms. He received urgent care at Mercy and Bay State where he was found to have heart failure with severely reduced LV systolic function (EF 20%). Ischemic evaluation including cardiac cath was negative. He has been compliant with good medical therapy and followed with serial, intermittent LV function assessments over the subsequent four years, including echo and more recently MRI revealing severely reduced EF ranging from 20% to 35%. He has had no further heart failure episodes since that time. 

He denies orthopnea, leg edema, weight gain or changes in abdominal girth. He further denies palpitations, syncope or near-syncope. He was told that needs to have a defibrillator to save his life from impending sudden death; it was also explained to him that because of his LBBB (which has been present from several years since his heart failure presentation in 2010) CRT will help restore a synchronous heart beat and help him feel better.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

Dear Dr. Parks

Reason for Visit: Evaluation for CRT-D.

 Mr. Signorelli is a pleasant 50 year-old gentleman with an unfortunate history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. After several years of follow-up at an outside institution he presented to MGH in May of this year for further evaluation and management and has now been subsequently referred for CRT-D implantation. 

As is known, his cardiac history began in 2010, when he subacutely developed fatigue, exertional dyspnea and chest discomfort, preceded by URI symptoms. He received urgent care at Mercy and Bay State where he was found to have heart failure with severely reduced LV systolic function (EF 20%). Ischemic evaluation including cardiac cath was negative. He has been compliant with good medical therapy and followed with serial, intermittent LV function assessments over the subsequent four years, including echo and more recently MRI revealing severely reduced EF ranging from 20% to 35%. He has had no further heart failure episodes since that time. 

He was let go of his previous job in construction around January of this year, but has stayed relatively active around the house including moderate yard work. He rides a bike and plays baseball for exercise, but reports some decline in his functional capacity over the last year. He denies orthopnea, leg edema, weight gain or changes in abdominal girth. He further denies palpitations, syncope or near-syncope. He was told that needs to have a defibrillator to save his life from impending sudden death; it was also explained to him that because of his LBBB (which has been present from several years since his heart failure presentation in 2010) CRT will help restore a synchronous heart beat and help him feel better.

  height 70 in
  resp. rate 14 BPM
  Pulse 79 bpm
  BMI 27.8 Overweight, moderate risk. 
  BP 110/60 mmHg

Physical examination: 
-Extremities: No edema 
-Abdomen: Large and slightly distended, but soft and nontender
-Cardiac: Left ventricular impulse is slightly displaced laterally. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2; no S3 or S4 are appreciated. 
-Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
-Neck: Carotids brisk bilaterally without bruits. Normal JVP estimate; no jugular venous distention.
-General: No acute distress.

 EKG:
 Sinus rhythm today; 86 bpm; LBBB; QRS 154 ms

Assessment and Plan: 
Mr. Signorelli is a 50 year-old gentleman referred for CRT-D implantation due to chronic, nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Given his symptoms, severely reduced LV function despite good medical therpay and LBBB he is an appropriate candidate for resynchronization therapy with defibrillator capacity for primary sudden cardiac death prevention. 

Cardiomyopathy .. - Reported NYHA Class II-III by recent evaluation at MGH HF and Cardiac Transplant Center. Clinically euvolemic today on guideline-directed medical therapy.
He meets indications for CRT-D implantation and is furthermore a good candidate on account of wide QRS LBBB and the absence of coronary disease by cath and MRI. This was discussed at length with Mr. Signorelli together with his signficant other who was present in the room and they expressed clear understanding and wish to proceed with CRT-D implantation. 

The RESPOND trial was also discussed; they expressed interest in enrollment and will be contacted by the study coordinator. 

Habits/Risk Screening: 
Smoking status: never smoked 
Alcohol use status: none/minimal Has cut down. Used to drink 2 alcoholic beverages or more everyday; now drinks 0 to 1 per day
Drug use status: none 
Activity level: moderate 

 DX Tests Ordered:
 Will need pre-implantation labs and CXR

Disposition:
Please schedule CRT-D implantation for Tuesday 7/15/14. Will anticipate a 6 month arrhythmia clinic f/u after that. 

 Education/Counselling:

Thank you again for referring your patient to the MGH Cardiac Arrhythmia Service. It is a pleasure to participate in his care. We will continue to follow with you. 
The patient was seen by Dr. Heist, who reviewed the history, physical examination and relevant diagnostic test reports and determined the assessment and plan.

 Reason for visit:
 Upgrade of pacemaker device to a CRT-D device

 Interval History:
 Mr. Randall Conrad is a very pleasant 66 year old gentleman with a history of sick sinus syndrome S/P pacemaker implantation with a co-existent primary cardiomyopathy. He also has a composite aortic graft for a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, aortic valve replacement. 

Mr. Conrad seems to be doing quite well but has been gradually noted to have progressive dyspnea and his NYHA class appears to be class II-III at this point in time. He does have mild dyspnea when he climbs stairs, which has now gradually become chronic. Associated with this, there has been a gradual decline in his ejection fraction from 37% now down to 20%. His right ventricular function and size are normal, however, his LV appears to be fairly dilated at 59 mm. Interestingly, he does have a peak gradient of 20 mmHg across his bioprosthetic valve and a mean gradient of 8 mmHg and clinical evidence of mild aortic insufficiency. 

He is saw me in the CRT Clinic recently for progressive dyspnea and declining ejection fraction with a new onset left bundle branch block for potentially cardiac resynchronization therapy upgrade of his pacemaker. 

His medications currently include warfarin, aspirin, fluoxetine, trazodone, and beta blockers 25 mg once a day. An ACE-inhibitor has really been unable to be initiated in him on account of significantly low blood pressures.

 Changes to Allergies 
NKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: [reviewed]

Physical examination: 
-Pulse: 64 BPM 
-Extremities: no peripheral edema
-Abdomen: benign; no hepatosplenomegaly
-Cardiac: apical impulse is diffuse and laterally discplaced with a normal S1 and a prominent S2. He has a grade 2:6 ejection systolic murmur with a 2:6 decrescendo diastolic murmur along the left sternal edge suggestive of aortic incompetence
-Chest: lungs clear to auscultation
-Neck: JVP is elevated at 5 cm of water
-HEENT: benign
-General: He is well.
-BP: 110/70 

 EKG:
 09/22/2010: Normal sinus rhythm with a first-degree AV block, a left bundle branch block, and left atrial enlargement.

 Impression:
 In summary, Mr. Conrad is a very pleasant 66 year old gentleman S/P an aortic graft for sinus of Valsalva aneurysm and a dilated ascending aorta accompanied by an aortic valve replacement in July of 2008. He has a faint diastolic murmur post-op and has some mild gradient across the aortic valve. He clearly has had evidence of a worsening cardiomyopathy with a decline in his ejection fraction from 37% to 20%. It has been difficult to initiate ACE-inhibitors in the past but he has been recently started on beta blockers. He continues to have NYHA class II-III symptoms. 

Interestingly he developed a new left bundle branch in January of 2009. He is not paced very frequently and it appears like his cardiomyopathy is a nonischemic one and has been progressively worsening. 

Clearly, Mr. Conrad meets all the criteria for an upgrade of his pacemaker device to a CRT-D device and he wishes to proceed. I discussed in detail with him that he has evidence of electrical as well as mechanical dyssynchrony associated with a compromised ejection fraction and significant symptoms. He is willing to participate in the DIRECT study and will have a CT venogram performed pre-procedurally for the same. We will also try to enroll him in the Biomarker study to help ascertain if there are any biomarker predictors of declining cardiac function. 

Mr. Conrad has been scheduled for the implantation on 11/10/2010. I have explained to him all the potential risks and benefits of the implantation procedure. He understands the risks of pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death, but also understands the potential benefit that may be acquired from the resynchronization component of a CRT-D device.

Dear Eric,

 I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Randall Conrad in the Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Clinic on 09/22/2010. As you may recall, Mr. Conrad is a very pleasant 66 year old gentleman with a history of sick sinus syndrome S/P pacemaker implantation with a co-existent primary cardiomyopathy. He also has a composite aortic graft for a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, aortic valve replacement. 

Mr. Conrad seems to be doing quite well but has been gradually noted to have progressive dyspnea and his NYHA class appears to be class II-III at this point in time. He does have mild dyspnea when he climbs stairs, which has now gradually become chronic. Associated with this, there has been a gradual decline in his ejection fraction from 37% now down to 20%. His right ventricular function and size are normal, however, his LV appears to be fairly dilated at 59 mm. Interestingly, he does have a peak gradient of 20 mmHg across his bioprosthetic valve and a mean gradient of 8 mmHg and clinical evidence of mild aortic insufficiency. 

He is seeing me in the clinic today for progressive dyspnea and declining ejection fraction with a new onset left bundle branch block for potentially cardiac resynchronization therapy upgrade of his pacemaker. 

His medications currently include warfarin, aspirin, fluoxetine, trazodone, and beta blockers 25 mg once a day. An ACE-inhibitor has really been unable to be initiated in him on account of significantly low blood pressures.

Physical examination: 
-Pulse: 64 BPM 
-General: He is well.
-HEENT: benign
-Neck: JVP is elevated at 5 cm of water
-Chest: lungs clear to auscultation
-Cardiac: apical impulse is diffuse and laterally discplaced with a normal S1 and a prominent S2. He has a grade 2:6 ejection systolic murmur with a 2:6 decrescendo diastolic murmur along the left sternal edge suggestive of aortic incompetence
-Abdomen: benign; no hepatosplenomegaly
-Extremities: no peripheral edema
-BP: 110/70 

 EKG:
 09/22/2010: Normal sinus rhythm with a first-degree AV block, a left bundle branch block, and left atrial enlargement.

 Impression:
 In summary, Mr. Conrad is a very pleasant 66 year old gentleman S/P an aortic graft for sinus of Valsalva aneurysm and a dilated ascending aorta accompanied by an aortic valve replacement in July of 2008. He has a faint diastolic murmur post-op and has some mild gradient across the aortic valve. He clearly has had evidence of a worsening cardiomyopathy with a decline in his ejection fraction from 37% to 20%. It has been difficult to initiate ACE-inhibitors in the past but he has been recently started on beta blockers. He continues to have NYHA class II-III symptoms. 

Interestingly he developed a new left bundle branch in January of 2009. He is not paced very frequently and it appears like his cardiomyopathy is a nonischemic one and has been progressively worsening. 

Clearly, Mr. Conrad meets all the criteria for an upgrade of his pacemaker device to a CRT-D device. I discussed this in detail with him that he has evidence of electrical as well as mechanical dyssynchrony associated with a compromised ejection fraction and significant symptoms. He is willing to participate in the DIRECT study and will have a CT venogram performed pre-procedurally for the same. We will also try to enroll him in the Biomarker study to help ascertain if there are any biomarker predictors of declining cardiac function. 

Mr. Conrad has been scheduled for the implantation in early November. I have explained to him all the potential risks and benefits of the implantation procedure. He understands the risks of pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death, but also understands the potential benefit that may be acquired from the resynchronization component of a CRT-D device. 

I thank you once again for allowing me to participate in his care. With kind regards. 

Sincerely, 

Jagmeet P. Singh, M.D., Ph.D.

Office visit 

Re: Randall Conrad
MGH #: 191-08-12

Mr. Conrad returns for follow-up of his composite aortic graft for a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, AVR, post-op sick sinus syndrome, PPM, and primary cardiomyopathy. His blood pressure has been in the 120s locally. He is active and feels well overall. He walks quite a bit during the day for exercise, but does not have a formal routine. He denies chest pain. He denies dyspnea on exertion on level ground, but he does have occasional mild dyspnea with stairs or inclines, which is now chronic. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or pedal edema. He denies lightheadedness, dizziness, or palpitations. His had a pacemaker check 3/10. He underwent an echocardiogram today that showed, by my review of the images, mild mitral regurgitation, left atrial enlargement, a bioprosthetic AVR with a peak gradient of 20 mmHg and a mean gradient of 8 mmHg, mild aortic insufficiency, a dilated LV at 59 mm, inferior akinesis and diffuse hypokinesis with an EF of 20%, trace tricuspid regurgitation, normal RV size and function, and an RVSP of 29 mmHg. 

MEDICATIONS: Warfarin 2-4 mg qhs (followed by Dr. Bernstein), aspirin 81 mg qd (for possible vertebral artery thrombus in early 1990s), fluoxetine 30 mg daily, trazodone 12.5 mg qpm, fish oil 1200 mg qd, flax seed oil 1200 mg daily. Amoxicillin dental prophylaxis (AVR). ALLERGIES: Ciprofloxacin (? reaction). No known contrast allergy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He appears well, overall. His blood pressure is 134/80, with a pulse of 64 and respirations 16. His weight is 165 lb. His median sternotomy is well healed. His lungs are clear throughout. His apical impulse is diffuse and laterally displaced, with a regular rate and rhythm, a normal S1 and a prominent A2, with a soft S3 but no S4. There is a I/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border, and a I-II/IV decrescendo diastolic murmur at the lower left sternal border. His jugular venous pressure is 6-7 cm and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally without bruits. His abdomen is benign, without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, or a dilated aorta. There is no pedal edema and posterior tibial pulses are 2+ bilaterally. 

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM: Normal sinus rhythm, first-degree AV block, left bundle branch block, left atrial enlargement. No change from baseline. 

IMPRESSION: 

1.Composite aortic graft for sinus of Valsalva/root aneurysm and dilated ascending thoracic aorta in 7/08 by Dr. Hilgenberg: His follow-up CTA of 1/09 shows normal post-op anatomy. Given that he had a prior aortoiliac aneurysm repair by Dr. Cambria in 2005, he has the potential to develop further aortic pathology and will therefore undergo surveillance imaging with CTAs every 4-5 years or so (next in 2013). 

2.Pericardial AVR (25 mm) in a composite graft in 7/08: He has a faint diastolic murmur post-op, and his echocardiogram 9/10 shows normal gradients with only mild central aortic insufficiency. He takes amoxicillin prophylaxis. 

3.Moderate cardiomyopathy with an EF of 37% pre-op, 36% post-op in 9/08, but now down to 20%: His pre-op 64 slice cardiac CT showed no CAD. His most recent echocardiogram of 9/10 showed inferior and posterior akinesis with diffuse hypokinesis and an EF of 20%. His 64-slice cardiac CTA confirmed an old inferior and posterior myocardial infarction of uncertain etiology (no CAD) with associated moderate cardiomyopathy. He has not had any signs of CHF. His only symptom is dyspnea on exertion with stairs. He had previously not had blood pressure room for a beta-blocker or ACEI. I would like to start him on a low dose of metoprolol succinate and then add a low dose of lisinopril. He is already on warfarin, which will protect him from apical thrombus. I will refer him to Dr. Jag Singh for consideration of CRT. He will undergo surveillance echocardiograms every 3 months for now. 

4.Sick sinus syndrome, with post-op paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and bradycardia, s/p PPM 8/08: He is currently in normal sinus rhythm. He is followed by the pacemaker clinic. His pacemaker interrogation in 9/09 showed recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, so we'll continue the warfarin indefinitely. I will refer him to Dr. Jag Singh for consideration of CRT.

5.New left bundle branch block 1/09: Perhaps related to his cardiomyopathy. He has no CAD. 

He will return for follow-up in 3 months with an echocardiogram on the day of the visit. I have reviewed this care plan and the medications with the patient and all questions were answered. The duration of this visit and review of relevant data was 40 min, > 50% of which was spent counseling the patient with regard to cardiomyopathy and its management.

Name: HENRY,THOMAS D 

BWH MRN: 29349602(BWH) 

Date of Birth: 04/10/92 

Date of Admission: 05/19/2014 

Attending: Morrow 

Date of transfer out of CCU: 5/25/2014 


Reason for CCU Admission: VFib, ICD shocks x2 


History of the Present Ilness: 22M with dilated cardiomyopathy (last EF reportedly 14% 5/2014), prior VF/VT, s/p AICD placement 1/2014, s/p 2 failed VT ablations in the past 2 months, undergoing workup for transplant, here after his AICD fired today x2.  


All prior care at Medical University of Sourth Carolina (college student here), including transplant workup for which he has undergone RHC. Now in the process of transferring care to BWH but has yet to come for a visit.  


History from patient, parents, and EP note. Had Vfib triggered by PVCs, and an ICD was placed for secondary prevention (dual chamber, Medtronic) in 1/2014. Subsequently had 2 failed VT RFAs (7 weeks ago and 3 weeks ago). ICD has fired total 12 times per patient.  He has previously developed hyperthyroidism with amiodarone, and is currently on sotalol 320 mg BID and mexiletine 150 mg BID.  


He was hospitalized at MUSC 5/9-5/13, 2014 after his ACID fired x3 at home and then x3 in the ED. This was attributed to electrolyte disturbances, and was treated briefly with amiodarone before being transitioned back to home doses of sotalol and mexiletene.    


Yesterday, felt very aware of his AICD and afraid it might go off.  Today he was feeling more tired than usual. Laying in bed, working on his computer.  Then felt dizzy, everything went dark, and lost consciousness.  As he was coming back to consciousness, felt AICD fire at 6:15pm. 20 minutes later, parents drove to ED, during drive felt dizzy again, LOC, AICD fired again while regaining consciousness.  


No palpitations or chest pain with these episodes. Does have intermittent palpitations not associated with defibrillator shocks.  

Denies current lightheadedness, SOB.  


Emergency Department Course: 

Initial VS: T 99.2, HR 40, v-paced, BP 127/65, RR 7, 100% on RA 

Exam: JVP flat, RRR, pacer site c/d/i, no overlying erythema 

Labs: TnT negative, TSH 9, electrolytes WNL 

Imaging: CXR w ICD leads in good position 

Interventions: Lidocaine bolus 50, gtt at 1 


EKG: V-paced at times, 3-5 beat runs of NSVT 

EP consulted: ICD interrogation revealed 2 shocks for Vfib, rate 220-250 at 7:20pm and 6:19pm, one episodes of anti-tachycardia pacing rate 22 at 6:56pm. Multiple prior ATP episodes for VF rates> 200. ICD programmed DDD 70 with short AV delays to suppress PVCs. Recommended continuing IV lidocaine gtt. CHF team aware of admission.   


CCU Course 5/19-22/2014 

# VT: EP was consulted prior to admission to CCU and device interrogation showed 2 shocks as described in the HPI. ICD interrogation revealed PVC triggered VF with two different morphologies that triggered VF. Baseline EKG without QTc prolongation. His ICD was reprogrammed to DDD 70 with short AV delays to suppress PVCs. He continued on the lidocaine gtt. EP recommended discontinuing mexilitine, continuining sotalol and starting quinidine 200mg TID which was started on 5/21. He had no further VF events after this change and lidocaine gtt was discontinued on 5/21. During the day, he developed bigeminy with short runs of VT, but remained hemodynamically stable.  EP increased pacing rate to 85 in an attempt to suppress PVCs; also increased quinidine to 400 TID.  Sotalol was transiently decreased for increasing QTc to 617, but was increased back to 240 BID.  He underwent repeact echo that demonstrated LV moderately dilated and spherically remodeled; normal wall thickness; EF 15-20%, global hypokinesis; abnormal septal motion c/w IVCD. On 5/23, EP decrased his pacing rate to 70 bpm and he subsequently had an episode of VT and near-syncope; his ICD fired and he was subsequently AV paced. His AV pacing was increased back to 85 bpm and he had no further episodes of ectopy. Given tthat he did not tolerate a lower pacing rate and at the higher pacing rate is paced for all of his beats, CRT-D was planned for this admission. Endocrine was paged regarding possibility of amiodarone who felt was okay to start if necessary and would just monitor TFTs.  


# CV-pump:  He was warm and dry on admission with no e/o heart failure. He has a history of  non-ischemic, dilated CMP, EF reportedly 14%.  Repeat echo demonstrated EF 15-20%.  He had been  underoing work-up of heart transplant in North Carolina. The heart failure team was consulted re: role of advanced thearpies and work-up for heart transplant as he decided to transfer his care to Boston. OSH records were obtained to not duplicate prior work-up, and transplant labs were sent as needed. He was seen by Social work, pharmacy, and psych for pre-transplant eval. He continued his home regimen of lisinopril, carvedilol, aldactone, and lasix. His pre-transplant evaluation will continue after transfer to the CHF service.  


# Endo: Endocrinology was consulted given consideration of amiodarone therapy. Patient has a history of hyperthyroidism with amiodarone and is currently on methimazole. Endocrine felt that amiodarone could be considered with close monitoring of thyroid function. Thyroid ablation was felt to be too high risk, either surgically (given likely need for peri-operative ECMO) or radioactively (risk for thyrotoxicosis precipitating VT).  


# Psych: Psychiatry was consulted. Patient has a history of anxiety/PTSD related to repeated ICD shocks. They recommended sertraline but this was deferred given risk of QTc prolongation. He was managed with PO ativan PRN. He was continued on ambien 5mg QHS which was a home medication.

Brief History of Current Health Status/Co-morbidities:Medical history in patients own words: Pt says that his cardiac illness began when he was 15 and felt weak while playing baseball. He then went to a doctor who thought he may have pericarditis but then a trip to the ED revealed cardiomyopathy. He says that since January he has felt increasingly worse and was being evaluated for a heart transplant at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) before coming to Massachusetts for the summer. He did not complete the evaluation there. He reports that since January he has been shocked 10 times by his ICD. Patient's Thoughts about VAD/Transplant: Pt says that thinking about transplant makes him feel nervous and scared. He feels overwhelmed by the process in general and has some specific concerns about the surgery and recovery.  He also says that "it doesn't feel real" and that he doesn't feel that he is ill enough to need a transplant. He is able to discuss transplant in general saying that "you get on the list, then wait for a donor, then have the surgery and then is the recovery." He is aware of the need for immunosuppressive medications and the potential for rejection as one complication.  His current thoughts around transplant focus on his concern that he will not be able to complete school in the fall or begin a career. He says "I ask myself, will I finish school this year? will I get a job? and the answer in my head is always no." He is also able to provide basic information about the LVAD, describing batteries and the driveline, but otherwise has a minimal understanding of the social/physical/emotional effects of such a device.  He says that he would want to learn more about advanced therapies if his team feels that he needs them but says that right now he is overwhelmed by the amount of information he's receiving and is taking in information slowly to lessen the anxiety he feels about being ill and potentially needing transplant. Additional medical history per medical records: per LMR: Dilated cardiomyopathyy diagnosed at age 15; s/p AICD (Medtronic) implanted 1/2014; ablations x 3 (?for VT); amio-induced hyperthyroidism; generalized anxiety/PTSD

Patient's Mental Health History:[X]History of inpatient/outpatient mental health services: Pt saw an outpatient therapist approximately 3 years ago after his mother and sister urged him to. They were concerned about depression because of increased irritability, negative self talk and poor school performance.  From pt's description of the therapy it was CBT and he found it to be helpful.  He stopped after approximately one year because he felt that his symptoms had improved and "we were just chatting about stuff that wasn't important." He is interested in resuming therapy to help with his anxiety about his illness, recent ICD shocks and increased feelings of depression. He reports that he has an appointment with a therapist near his parents house on 05/27/14. Pt has had several ICD firings since January of this year and reports increased anxiety and worries about future firings. He avoids public places for fear of being shocked and passing out, which he would find embarrassing. He also avoids certain situations/environments that he was in when the device fired in the past such as going to the beach. He also reports nightmares about the hospitalization and the ICD. Provider Info: pt did not have info today[X]History of Psychiatric Medication Use: Clonazepam in the past for anxiety was not helpful. [NO]History of Psychiatric Hospitalizations[NO]History of SI/SA

Past/Present Coping Skills and Strategies: reading, hiking and talking to his girlfriend and family. 

How patient is coping with current illness: Pt is coping reasonably well with this hospitalization. He struggles to cope with certain aspects of his illness (ICD firings and potential need for transplant) and has noticed increased anxiety and a more depressed mood recently. His parents are in the hospital for support. 

Mood/Affect: "ok" / full rangeAdditional Stressors: concerns about not being able to complete school or begin a career, lack of social supports in MA other than parents

Narrative:  

SW met w/ pt at bedside to provide support and to complete psychosocial assessment as part of VAD/transplant evaluation.  Mr. Henry is a lovely 22 y/o single male who is currently living with his mother and father in Boylston, MA.  He very recently moved to Massachusetts as he has been living in Conway, South Carolina where he is a student at Coastal Carolina University.  He has never lived in Massachusetts before, he grew up in Georgia and South Carolina.  His primary supports in Massachusetts are his mother, Terry, and his father, Chuck. His mother is a real estate agent and has a flexible schedule. She reports that she can be available as needed to support patient after discharge. His father is also supportive and is able to take time from work as needed to support pt.  Pt has a grandmother who lives in the area and he says that he is somewhat close with her. Since he has never lived here before he does not have a network of friends for socialization and emotional support. In South Carolina, he is supported by his girlfriend Sharayah and multiple friends. While they are strong emotional supports, they are all college students with limited ability to provide practical support for VAD or transplant. 


Mr. Henry reports to me today that his ICD has fired 10 times since January and, as a result, he is now experiencing PTSD symptoms including avoiding situations that he was in when the firing occurred, avoiding crowds because he is afraid that his ICD will go off while he's in public, nightmares and pervasive thoughts.  He has had panic attacks as well. He states that he's been feeling more depressed lately as a result of his declining health and the need to pursue an advanced therapies evaluation. He has been in therapy before and found CBT to be quite helpful. He has found a therapist in Boylston and has an appointment to see her next week to work on his anxiety, depression and coping skills. SW has made a referral to Reiki for this hospitalization. 


Mr. Henry says that he was somewhat surprised to find that he may be a heart transplant candidate because he did not think that he was sick enough to warrant advanced therapies. He has some overall knowledge of transplant but has not yet considered many of the possible risks/benefits/responsibilities.  He feels "nervous" and "scared" when thinking of his health problems and potential need for transplant and has serious concerns about his future, especially around graduating from college and beginning a career.  He would like to learn more about transplant and VAD if it is decided that he is a medically appropriate candidate. 

Strengths: future oriented, motivated to seek medical treatment for heart condition, motivated to seek help for depression/anxiety

Quality of Support: pt has good supports in Massachusetts from his mother and father.  His support system in South Carolina is considerably weaker being only a girlfriend and some friends. 

Concerns: pt has concerns about his future and the ability to return to school. He is concerned about his health and uncertain about his future medically and socially. 

Specific Hopes/Fears: pt hopes to be able to continue with only medical management of his heart condition. He hopes to be able to return to school in the fall and start working after graduation.  He is fearful that he won't be able to return to college because of his medical issues. 

Assessment of potential recipients' ability to adhere to therapeutic regimens: good compliance potential.

Pt's current understanding of potential risks/benefits/responsibilities of VAD/transplant: minimal understanding at this time. Pt is overwhelmed by the transplant evaluation and the amount of information he has already received but is interested in learning more about advanced therapies should he be deemed an appropriate candidate. 


No psychosocial contraindication to advanced therapies at this time. Pt will benefit from outpatient CBT for depression and anxiety.  Pt will benefit from continued education about treatment options as they become clear to medical team - he appreciates being given information when his mother or father is present. 


Patient Interventions/Education:

Reviewed chart, introduced self to pt, described role of SW on the cardiac transplant and VAD team.

Provided education around the potential emotional impact and psychological aspects of transplantation including increased stress, anxiety, depression, guilt, etc.

Discussed the potential risks and benefits of VAD/transplant including the need for lifelong medication and routine follow up at BWH (and need for transportation to clinic appointments and procedures).

Assessed pt's understanding of the risk/benefits/responsibilities of advanced therapies and addressed pt's questions and concerns about the VAD/transplant process.

Gathered psychosocial information pertaining to pt's ability to comply with a complicated medical regimen in the post-transplant period.

Assessed pt's coping abilities and strategies and provided emotional support to pt and supports around the stress and fears associated with advanced therapies.

Discussed the non-medical expenses (transportation to and from BWH, lodging, meals, parking) associated with VAD/transplant.

Encouraged pt and family to follow-up w/ PFR about parking validation and/or vouchers.   

SW provided pt with copies of:SW contact information; encouraged pt to call, e-mail or page with any additional questions or concerns. Advanced Directives forms, requesting pt complete form and give to staff to be included in pt's medical records.  SW encouraged pt to discuss HCP and advanced directives with family.BWH Pike MapBWH Guidelines for a family member staying at bedsideCaring Bridge pamphletReiki informationTransplant fund raising informationParking Assistance Form (for vouchers through PFR)Information about what is expected of Support Network during VAD/transplant processPlan 

SW will discuss case w/ team and will remain available to pt throughout the hospitalization.  Please contact SW w/ any questions/concerns.

BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL ATTENDING PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION NOTE 


PATIENT:     Henry, Thomas         MR#:   29349602 

DATE:        5/21/14            TIME:     2:40 PM   


I have performed the key elements of the history and examination, and reviewed the laboratory results, in collaboration with Dr. Teslyar.   I have reviewed the fellow's note and agree with the documented findings and recommendations.    Hx obtained from patient and records. 


Mr. Henry is a 22 year old college student with dilated cardiomyopathy (last EF reportedly 14% 5/2014), prior VF/VT, s/p AICD placement 1/2014, s/p 2 failed VT ablations in the past 2 months, undergoing workup for transplant at Medical University of South Carolina, who was admitted to BWH on 5/19/14 after his AICD fired  x2.  Following Mr. Henry's ICD implantation, the device fired the day it was placed, once in March, 6 times on May 9th and twice on 5/19/14.  While Mr. Henry is hospitalized, he is completing evaluation for transplantation/VAD.  Of note, Mr. Henry's mother has a history of cardiomyopathy for which she received heart transplantation 20 years ago. 


Mr. Henry reports seeing a therapist several years ago due to generalized anxiety symptoms and panic attacks. He reports that the therapist felt that he had PTSD at that time, related to his cardiac issues. HE was treated with cognitive behavioral therapy with good effect, although he reports that the panic attacks have persisted, occurring up to 2x per week. He reports that since receiving ICD shocks in January, he has had increasing anxiety with intrusive thoughts about the shocks, nightmares, avoidance fo activities, fear of being alone at home and difficulty sleeping. He has been taking clonazepam 0.25 mg bid with minimal effect. He also feels that his mood has been getting increasingly depressed since January and reports feeling somewhat hopeless about his future, what he will do after college, how long he will live if he receives a heart transplant.  Mr. Henry reports reading the internet and becoming somewhat focused on statistics about heart transplant. 


Mr. Henry reports that he has been treated with cardiac medications for many years. He reports that when he was 15 yo, he was "in denial" about his cardiac condition, but reports that his mother "took it out of my hands" and managed his medications. Since college, he reports that he has been solely responsible for his medications and "gets panicked if I take my medication 5 minutes late." He reports that he copes with his illness by reading and occasionally, by eating "comfort foods" such as pizza and wings. 


EXAMINATION:   Young man lying in bed, awake and alert, pleasant and cooperative with interview. Eye contact good. Speech fluent. No involuntary movements. Mood "I think I'm getting a little depressed" Affect appears anxious, restricted in range. TP linear TC no suicidality or psychosis. Insight good. Judgement good. 


IMPRESSION:   Mr. Henry is a 22 yo man with a history of generalized anxiety and panic attacks, who has now been experiencing symptoms of PTSD following repeated firing of his ICD. In addition, he reports that his mood has been getting increasingly depressed, as he tries to come to terms with his diagnosis and how his treatment options will impact his future in college, his career options and his life expectancy.  Given that his symptoms have been progressing over the past 5 months, would recommend initiation of an SSRI such as sertraline for treatment of his PTSD symptoms and depressed mood.  While the SSRI is taking effect, would continue a benzodiazepine (he has found lorazepam more helpful than clonazepam) for treatment of anxiety.  In addition, he would likely benefit from referral to outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy for management of his anxiety and for support around his medical illness. 


RECOMMENDATIONS:  As per Dr. Teslyar.

HPI:  22 year old single Caucasian male presents with worsening heart failure due to dialated cardiomyopathy.  Patient had AICD placed 1/2014 dut to ventricular tachycardia, he reports that the device fired the day it was placed, once in March, 6 times on May 9th and twice 2 days ago.  Patient has had two ablations in the past and is now admitted to control his arhythmia and to be avaluated for possible transplantation. 

Patiet is a college student, styding finance in South Carolina.  His parents live locally and he is here to spend the summer with them.  He reports that he was intially diagnosed with cardiomyopathy at age 15 after he felt ill while playing baseball.  His mother also has cardiomyopathy and was transplanted 20 years ago.  He reports that his health had been generally good and his condition did not significantly impact his life until 5 months ago when he experienced worsening heart failure, arhythmias and required AICD placement.  Patient reports a history of long standing generalized anxiety that he describes as chronic daily worries, physical experience of shortness of breath, dizziness.  Since his device has fired patient now reports worsening anxiety and panic attacks (these occure 2-3 times per week and last several minutes).  He reports that when the device activates he initially feels dizziness and then passes out. These experiences are very frightening.  He reports that he now has increased anxiety, worries about when next firing will occure, avoids activites that he was doing when device fired.  He reports nightmares about hospitlizations. Additionally, as his panic episodes are often accompanied by feelings of dizziness, this makes him worry that his device is about to discharge as well.   He reports chronic negative thoughts about the transplant process, the statistics involved, feelng that he must 'delay my life' and that he will not be able to return to school or pursue a career.  He describes his mood a 'slightly depressed'.  He reports poor sleep due to nightmares, but reports good appetite and denies anhedonia. He is extremely future oriented and denies any thoughts of suicide or passive death wish.            

Patient reports good adherence to treatment, has scheduled routine for remembering to take his medications. Denies tobacco, alcohol or drug use due to health concerns.

IMPRESSION:            22 year old Caucasian male with dilated cardiomyopathy, AICD, history of generalized anxiety presents for evaluation for tranpslantation.  Patient has been living with his illness since 15 years of age and reports good adherence to treatment and healthy life style.  Patient has had a decline in his physical health since January of 2014 and has had to have an AICD implanted, the device has fired on numereous occasions in the past 4 months.  Patient reports classic  symptoms of PTSD secondary to AICD firiing of anxiety, anticipation, avoidance, intrusive thoughts, nightmares.  He has benefited from psychotherapy for anxiety in the past but has limited access currently due to driving restrictions.  He reports that previous treatment with benzodiazepines has not been helpful. Engaged patient in a discussion of the risk versus benefits of SSRI treatment, including risk of QTc prolongation, he feels that this is a treatment he is interested in pursuing to help with his mood and anxiety symptoms.  Patient's anxiety and mood symptoms predominately center around his cardiac illness and the impact he worries it will have on his life.  Treating patient's anxiety disorder will help him improve his chances for successful tranplantation. 


DIAGNOSIS:          Axis I:          Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 

Axis II:         deferred 

Axis III:       heart failure, AICD activation 

Axis IV:        chronic worsening illness 

Axis V:          60 


RECOMMENDATIONS:       

1. Patient would benefit from outpatient therapy to help cope with anxiety, due to transportation issues recommend seeking treatment near home in Worcester area 

2. Recommend starting Zoloft 25 mg po daily to help with mood and anxiety symptoms.   

3. Can continue clonazepam or lorazepam for the short term while zoloft takes several weeks to take effect, would recommed tappering off once symptoms controlled with SSRI 

4. Would avoid using ambien as patient has history of parasomnia with it 

5. Continue to provide support and education to patient regarding transplantation process

----------------------------------- 


Name: Thomas Henry 

MRN: 29349602 

Date of admission: 5/19/14 

Attending requesting consult: Dr. David Morrow 

----------------------------------- 


Reason for consult: History of amiodarone induced thyroxicosis, ?evaluate for potential indication for ablation or thyroidectomy 


HPI:           

Mr. Henry Thomas is a 22-year-old male with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who is admitted with vfib storm.  We are asked to consult the patient to determine if there is an indication for ablation or thyroidectomy (if the thyroid is contributing to vfib storm). 


He has a long-standing history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, vifb history s/p 3 ablations, and AICD placement in 1/2014.  Yesterday, he was tired, felt dizzy in bed, ACID fired, drove to ED where AICD fired again.  He was noted to be in VF and settings changed to suppress PVCs. 


He was started on amiodarone around age 15, continued on it for 2 years, then stopped for 1 year.  Amiodarone was restarted around age 18, then stopped in 1/2014 in setting of development of amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis.  He was evaluated at MUSC Endocrinology Clinic by Dr. Linda Meyers on 2/19/14 and was placed on MMI 40 mg PO qd and prednisone 20 mg PO qd (had been on this for 6 weeks).  Then on 3/3/14, he was evaluated by the inpatient endocrine team (admitted for VT ablation) and it was felt he had type 1 AIT or mixed picture as he did not respond necessarily to prednisone.  In this admission, they increased MMI to 20 mg PO TID and steroid were tapered (steroids stopped ~ 2 months ago now).  He saw Dr. Meyers on 4/29/14 and MMI was decreased from 20 mg PO TID to 20 mg PO BID.  The plan was to repeat TFTs in August 2013. 


Per MUSC records, there was note of pituitary adenoma as well.  When inquiring about this to patient, he states he has a history of pituitary micro or macroadenoma (unsure) which was found after he was evaluated by a endocrinologist at ?Reliant Medical (Worcester, MA) in 2012 when he sought evaluation for development of increased breast tissue.  This was determined to be related to his spironolactone use.  For the pituitary adenoma noted on MRI, it was followed serially in 2013 and was noted to be unchanged.

ASSESSMENT:   

22-year-old male with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis admitted in setting of vfib storm who appears clinically and biochemically euthyroid at this time.  His TSH is slightly elevated, but would err on the side of caution in terms of decreasing methimazole dose in setting of vfib.  Therefore, please continue same dose of methimazole.  The half-life of methimazole is approximately 3 months; therefore, amiodarone-induced thyroiditis should be resolving in the near future as patient last received dose in 1/2014.  We would recommend obtaining TSI Ab to evaluate for potential underlying Graves' that could suggest another reason for hyperthyroidism if resolution of hyperthyroid state is not resolved in the near future (when methimazole should be worn off). 


Primary team inquired about potential role for thyroid ablation or a thyroidectomy in patient's case as pt responded to amiodarone well (in terms of arrythmia perspective).   In the setting of unstable rhythm, we would not recommend ablation or thyroidectomy in the inpatient setting as methimazole would need to be held and this could disrupt patient's current euthyroid state and potentially contribute to vfib.   At this time, maintenance of euthyroid state in setting of vfib is priority.  If medication options are limited and amiodarone use is reconsidered, please inform our team prior to initiation.   


RECOMMENDATIONS: 

-Continue methimazole 20 mg PO BID.  Avoid holding dose(s) of methimazole.  If a dose needs to be held, please inform endocrine consult team before this occurs. 

-Please check TSI 

-Please recheck TSH, fT4, TT4, and TT3  on 5/27/14. 

-If amiodarone is going to be initiated during this admission, please inform endocrine team.  Will need to monitor TFTs more closely in this case. 

-These recommendations have been discussed with the CCU team and the HF team to which patient is being transferred to. 

-Please monitor for develop of rash, fever, sore throat, or agranulocytosis on CBC with differential.  Methimazole is held in these cases; therefore, endocrine team would need to be informed if this were to occur. 

-Pt will follow-up re: history of pituitary micro or macroadenoma (records unavailable) with his outpatient endocrinologist at Reliant Medical (Worcester, MA).

HPI 

He had been doing reasonably well w/ his CM until 1/2014 when he had Vfib and an AICD was placed. He had 3 VT ablations which were unsuccessful, last 7 weeks ago and 3 weeks ago in South Carolina (where he goes to college; parents live near Boston). He had been on Amio in the past but developped thyrotoxicosis, rX METHIMAZOLE so has been on Mexilitine adn Sotalol at home. He had a recent hosptitalization in South Carolina for x 3 ICD shocks thought to be secondary to electrolyte disturbances, treated w/ one IV amio bolus and then uptitration of sotalol and mexilitine. He had been in in usual state of health until yesterday. He had been feeling tired earlier in the day. While lying in bed he felt dizzy, everything went dark, as he was coming back to consciousness felt AICD fire at 6:15pm. Drove to ED, during drive felt dizzy again, LOC, AICD fired again. In the ED he had frequent PVCs. His device was interrogated, and VF was confirmed. His settings were changed by EP to DDD 70 with short AV delays to suppress PVCs.

Date of Admission: 05/19/2014 

Attending: Morrow 


Reason for CCU Admission: VFib, ICD shocks x2 


History of the Present Ilness: 22M with dilated cardiomyopathy (last EF reportedly 14% 5/2014), prior VF/VT, s/p AICD placement 1/2014, s/p 2 failed VT ablations in the past 2 months, undergoing workup for transplant, here after his AICD fired today x2.  


All prior care at Medical University of Sourth Carolina (college student here), including transplant workup for which he has undergone RHC. Now in the process of transferring care to BWH but has yet to come for a visit.  


History from patient, parents, and EP note.  Had Vfib triggered by PVCs, and an ICD was placed for secondary prevention (dual chamber, Medtronic) in 1/2014. Subsequently had 2 failed VT RFAs (7 weeks ago and 3 weeks ago). ICD has fired total 12 times per patient.  He has previously developed hyperthyroidism with amiodarone, and is currently on sotalol 320 mg BID and mexiletine 150 mg BID.  


He was hospitalized at MUSC 5/9-5/13, 2014 after his ACID fired x3 at home and then x3 in the ED. This was attributed to electrolyte disturbances, and was treated briefly with amiodarone before being transitioned back to home doses of sotalol and mexiletene.    


Yesterday, felt very aware of his AICD and afraid it might go off.  Today he was feeling more tired than usual. Laying in bed, working on his computer.  Then felt dizzy, everything went dark, and lost consciousness.  As he was coming back to consciousness, felt AICD fire at 6:15pm. 20 minutes later, parents drove to ED, during drive felt dizzy again, LOC, AICD fired again while regaining consciousness.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 22M with dilated cardiomyopathy (last EF reportedly 14% 5/2014), prior VF/VT, s/p AICD placement 1/2014, s/p 2 failed VT ablations in the past 2 months, undergoing workup for transplant, with VF/VT storm. 


# CVr: In VT/VF storm.  ICD interrogation revealed 2 shocks for Vfib and multiple episodes of Vfib that were treated with anti-tachycardia pacing. Most likely etiology poor substrate with dilated CM and progression of disease.  Other possible causes ischemia (unlikely with neg TnT, no EKG change, no CP), tox screen pending though denies use of substances, pro-arrythmic effect of mexilitine.  May need to consider advanced therapies. 

Dx: 

- Telemetry 

- TTE in AM. 

- F/u remaining tox panel 

Tx: 

- Cont lidocaine gtt, wean as tolerated 

- Cont home sotalol 

- D/c mexiletine and try quinidine 200 TID (consider thyroid ablation with subsequent amio if this doesnt work; see below) 

- Endo consult for reason above 

- May consider sympathectomy if no relief from above interventions 

- Avoid amiodarone given h/o thyroid dysfunction 

- Replete K> 4, Mg> 2 

- Cont home Mag-Oxide 

- Obtain OSH records: MUSC Dr. Wharton, 843-876-4766 

- F/u EP recs  


# CVp: Warm and dry currently with no e/o heart failure. H/o non-ischemic, dilated CMP, EF reportedly 14%.  Elevated BNP likely not suggestive of volume overload. 

- Cont home sotalol, lisinopril, carvedilol (Coreg), aldactone, lasix 

- TTE in AM 

- F/u heart failure team recs Re: workup for transplant, other advanced therapies 

- Obtain OSH records: MUSC Dr. Michael Craig 843-792-3355, RN Paulette 843-876-4807 


# CVi: No signs/sx of ischemia at this time. TnT< assay.  

- CTM 


# Thyroid: H/o hyperthyroidism 2/2 amiodarone. TSH 9 here. On methimazole at home, which was decreased from 20 mg TID to 20 mg BID about 1 month prior to presentation likely given over-supression of thyroid function as evidenced by elevated TSH here. Given that it may take some time for TSH to appropriately fall into normal range after dose adjustment, will not make acute changes to methimazole.  

- Cont home methimazole 20 BID 

- Avoid amiodarone  

- F/u OSH records  

- Endocrine consult for consideration of thyroid ablation in preparation for amio in the future

Code Status: Full but no prolonged life-sustaining measures. 

Contact: Son Frank 781-858-0841 

HCP: Wife 


Reason for Admission: Dizziness/lightheadedness x 3 days 


History of the Present Illness: 


Mr. Iannuzzi is a 74 year old male with known coronary artery disease s/p CABG 1991, ischemic cardiomyopathy, status post dual chamber ICD 2006 with Fidelis RV lead and pacemaker dependent due to complete heart block and paroxsymal atrial fibrillation in 2009 status post cardioversion who presented to the ED with dizziness and lightheadedness x 3 d found to have lead fracture. 


Patient had a dual chamber ICD implant in November of 2006 when he had presented with complete heart block and syncope. In June 2009 he was noted to have new-onset atrial fibrillation which had started in February of 2009 status post electrical cardioversion 6/19/2009.  He was last seen by Dr. Mela in July 2009 confirming that he requires ventricular pacing almost 100% of the time and has been medically managed with rate control strategy of beta-blocker and Coumadin. In November 2011, he presented with chest pain and had cardiac catheterization with stenting of the SVG to the OM. He has been followed by our ICD Clinic and is pacemaker dependent with a RV Fidelis lead.  His most recent ICD interrogation was 1/18/12 confirmed that monitoring parameters for Fidelis lead were stable.  Given his persistent fatigue, 100% ventricular pacing, stable EF in the 30% range and NYHA FC 2-3 symptoms, it was felt that he would benefit from upgrade to CRT-D. This was going to be planned for April 2012.   


However, over the last couple of days, patient has felt dizzy and lightheaded. He reports the episode of dizziness as lightheadedness almost pre-syncope without vertigo or disequilibrium, lasting a few seconds at a time, without triggers including position. He denies falls or syncope. His PM was interrogated on the phone today, and he was found to have a fractured lead. EMS was called for transport to the hospital. When EMS arrived the pt walked to the ambulance but felt somewhat dizzy. He was found pt to be in apparent Vtach but then spontaneously converted back to NSR. 


In the ED, EP fellow re-programmed pacemaker for continuous pacing mode. The ICD portion of the device was turned off and defibrillating pads were placed on the patient. The patient could not be taken to the EP lab directly because he had not been fasting. 


Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports feeling well without dizziness. He denies HA, CP, SOB, abdominal pain, dysuria, diarrhea/constipation, weakness/numbness, headache, changes in vision.

        Differential Diagnosis and Plan:
Differential Diag/Plan:74 yo male who is pacemaker dependant presents with concern for dizziness for the past three days, phone interegation of the pacer shows that there is a fractured lead so pt was told to come to the ED. When EMS arrived to pts house there was a question of a rapid HR and ? vtach but pt was asymptomatic at that time. Primary concern today is this 74 yo pacemaker dependent pt who has a fractured pacer lead and will require replacement of this. [bmb33]

ED Course/Reassessment:Pt assessed, clinically appears well at this point in time and vitals are stable. Labs ordered and sent, EP at bedside to irrigate the pacer. [bmb33]

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 Ischemic cardiomyopathy, s/p dual ch ICD with RV Fidelis lead and PPM dependent

 Interval History:
 Mr. Iannuzzi is a 74 year old male with known coronary artery disease status post CABG x3 in 1991 with ischemic cardiomyopathy. He underwent dual chamber ICD implant in November of 2006 when he had presented with complete heart block and syncope. In June 2009 he was noted to have new-onset atrial fibrillation which had started in February of 2009 status post electrical cardioversion 6/19/2009. 

He was last seen by Dr. Mela in July 2009 confirming that he requires ventricular pacing almost 100% of the time and has been medically managed with rate control strategy of beta-blocker and Coumadin. In November 2011 he presented with chest pain and had cardiac catheterization with stenting of the SVG to the OM. He has been followed by our ICD Clinic and is pacemaker dependent with RV Fidelis lead. 

His most recent ICD interrogation was 1/18/12 confirming monitoring parameters for Fidelis lead are stable but he remains pacemaker dependent. Also noted is slight elevation of atrial lead thresholds to 2V @ 1.5 ms. All other ICD measurements within normal limits. He is programmed DDD 60-130 bpm with 81% AP and 100% VP (pacer dependent). His most recent detection was NSVT @ 160 bpm x 20 seconds on 5/30/11 with no therapy. He returns today to discuss possible RV lead revision and even consideration of upgrade to cardiac resynchronization therapy. 

Today, he reports feeling OK with baseline fatigue. He continues to get mild SOB with climbing stairs but denies chest pain. He will get dizzy if bends over and feels palpitations but only for a few seconds. He is considering enrolling in Cardiac Rehab at end of month and had a stress test at Dr. Bowman's office about a week ago. He has been caring for his wife who is recovering from heart valve surgery.

 Other Data:
 Local cardiologist Dr. Bowman: Stress Test 2/2012, unavailable for review. 
phone 781-665-1207, fax 781-665-0581. He also follows INR levels. 

11/18/11 Echocardiogram at MGH showed dilated LV, LVIDd 65 mm, LVIDs 55mm with moderate LV dysfunction, posterior wall is best preserved with LV focal wall thinning and increased reflectivity suggestive of LV septal scar. No LV thrombus, LVEF 31%. No MVP, mild MR. LAE 47 x 51 x 59. No AI, no aortic dilatation. Trace TI, no PI, insufficient Tr to estimate RVSP. RV not dilated, RV dysfunction involving apex with overall RVSF within normal limits. No pericardial effusion. Compared to 10/2006, LVEF is lower with regional LVD now extending into inferior wall. 

11/17/11 Cardiac cath showed V-OM severe focal stenosis s/p Xience DES with V-RCA severe focal stenosis and LIMA-LAD patent. LV: 140/14. 

 Assessment and plan:
 Mr. Iannuzzi is a 74 year old male with known coronary artery disease s/p CABG 1991, ischemic cardiomyopathy, status post dual chamber ICD 2006 with Fidelis RV lead and pacemaker dependent due to complete heart block and paroxsymal atrial fibrillation in 2009 status post cardioversion. In November 2011 he underwent DES to SVG- OM1 with baseline LV dysfunction, EF 31%. He is optimally medically managed with ACEI, BB, Spironolactone and Coumadin. 

Today we reviewed his functional status and symptoms of HF, currently displaying NYHA FC 2-3 symptoms. We also confirmed he is pacemaker dependent with RV Fidelis lead and slightly elevated, but stable atrial lead thresholds. Most of the discussion today focused on revising his RV lead and the potential benefit from upgrade to CRT-D. His cardiologist Dr. Bowman has also recently raised the issue and discussed the same with him. 

Given his persistent fatigue, 100% ventricular pacing, stable EF in the 30% range and NYHA FC 2-3 symptoms we agreed he would benefit from upgrade to CRT-D. He had his questions answered and agrees to proceed; consent has been signed. He will have CRT-D upgrade (keep A lead, despite stable slightly elevated thresholds) with Dr. Mela in the ensuing weeks, with his preference to wait until early April to continue to give his wife time to recuperate from her valve surgery for which he has been providing her care. He will need a groin temp wire, as he is pacemaker dependent. A left venogram will be done to assess for patency. Lab and CXR will be completed as instructed. He will hold Coumadin 4 days prior. He will be referred to CRT Clinic after upgrade for optimization. 

It was a pleasure seeing Mr. Iannuzzi in the MGH Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic today. We will follow up with him as needed. Once CRT Clinic is completed, he will resume ICD Clinic as instructed. He will continue his Cardiology care with Dr. Bowman, as previous. He was encouraged to contact us if her/his clinical status changes in the meantime. 

Sincerely, 

Vanessa Preble, NP 

The patient was seen by Dr. Mela who confirmed the history of present illness, and reviewed the ROS, and past/family/social history. I also personally performed the comprehensive cardiac exam detailed above including examination of the jugular veins, auscultation of the lungs, palpation and auscultation of the heart. In addition, I examined the carotid arteries, the abdomen for masses and bruits, the femoral arteries, distal pulses, and extremities for peripheral edema, clubbing and cyanosis. I reviewed all diagnostic test reports, and assisted in determining the assessment and plan.

Problems: 
Complete atrioventricular block..
Ischemic cardiomyopathy..

HEART FAILURE SERVICE 

INITIAL CONSULTATION 

Patient Name: Teresa Reddoch 

DOB: 10/13/64 

MRN: 29513843 

Attending (requesting): William Bachman, M.D. 

Attending (consult): Michael Givertz, M.D. 


Reason for consult:  Newly recognized LV systolic dysfunction 


History of Present Illness: The patient is a 49 yoF with a history of alcohol abuse, bilateral breast cancer (last treated with chemotherapy ending in 2012) presents from Metrowest medical center with new LV systolic dysfunction.  She was admitted with fatigue and dyspnea, had a wide complex tachycardia with a left bundle branch block morphology, the same as her baseline ECG, for which she required DCCV and amiodarone, based on the severity of her illness she was transferred to BWH for further evaluation. 


She states she has felt unwell for about 3 months.  In April had a slow onset of dyspnea on exertion and fatigue.  Initially dyspneic with sweeping the floors, this slowly progressed to dyspnea with minimal exertion for the past 6 weeks, ultimately with dyspnea with any movement.  She also had chest pressure and occasional lightheadness associated with the dyspnea.  She has had 3 pillow orthopnea, sleeping at 45 degrees, several episodes of PND, no leg edema or weight change, she has had abdominal bloating and early satiety.   She had a cough for 1 month (rusty, clear sputum from end of May to the end of June) She has no prior history of syncope.  She feels her heart racing with exertion.   


Prior to this she was functional without any symptoms.  She had a screening ECG and echo prior to and after her chemotherapy in 2011/2012.   The rest of review of systems are negative. 


Past Medical History: 

Breast cancer: Infiltrating ductal CA of R breast, T2N1, IIb.  Lumpectomy, axillary node dissection and radiation therapy to R breast.  Chemotherapy with adriamycin, 5FU and cyclophosphamide.  Recurrence of infiltrating ductal CA of L breast, BRCA +.  This was ER, PR and Her-2 neu negative.  Treated with surgery and then she was treated with 4 cycles of epirubicin at a cumulative dose of 480mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide. Then treated with taxotere/taxol which she did not tolerate (tongue swelling) and switched to Eribulin Mesylate. This was followed by XRT to left breast.

CT scan chest 7/10/14:  

Diffuse lung changes with bilateral pleural effusions, areas of lucency and areas of interstitial thickening. Tiny nodules are present in the upper lobes as well as a 10 mm area of nodularity or consolidation. There is a left lower lobe process. Additionally, there is increased soft tissue density within the mediastinum. It is possible that some of these findings were related to cardiac dysfunction but the etiology of this process is not clear correlation with the patient's chemotherapy agents recommended.

Impression and Plan: 49 yoF with a history of breast cancer treated with anthracyclines, prior cocaine use and ETOH abuse, presents with acute decompensated heart failure, found to have severe LV systolic dysfunction.  The etiology of her heart failure is most likely related to prior anthracycline use, however, other possibilities include alcohol related or cocaine related cardiomyopathy.  She has a left bundle branch block, mild LV dilation and mild mitral regurgitation, a slightly low blood pressure and a S3.  She remains volume overloaded on exam, agree with increased dose of diuretics.  Would also change ARB to an ACEi, captopril 3.125mg po tid to start.  Very slow titration of beta blocker given slightly low blood pressure.  Tomorrow (7/24/14) can add spironolactone 12.5mg po daily.  Aspirin can be discontinued. 

We recommend a cardiac MRI which may add further prognostic information.  In addition, the patient has a plan for an EP study but would benefit from further diuresis prior to this, would suggest at least 24 hours of further diuresis prior to EP study.   


Obtaining records in regards to cumulative anthracycline dose as well as prior echocardiogram would be useful.  Following discharge from the hospital the patient should follow up with the heart failure team from BWH, either Dr. Michael Givertz or Dr. Anju Nohria.  She also would like to follow with Dr. Vikas Desai from Natick which would be reasonable in the long run after short term stabilization. The patient expressed wishes to return to work immediately following discharge from the hospital, this is not advised.  She should be instructed to follow up with the heart failure team outpatient to ensure stability prior to consideration of returning to work. 


Please do not hesitate to call with any questions.   


Sachin Shah, M.D. 

Asked by Dr. Bachman to evaluate this 49 yo woman with h/o breast cancer transferred from outside hospital for management of newly diagnosed CMP c/b tachyarrhythmia and severe heart failure.  Patient seen and examined on Shapiro 8W with Dr. Shah.  Please see note above for details of HPI, PMH, medications, FH, SH, PE and diagnostic evaluation.  Patient remains dyspneic with walking in hallway, anxious and intermittently tearful.  Exam notable for volume overload and low normal perfusion.  Most likely represents anthracycline-induced CMP, possibly exacerbated by alcohol and/or cocaine.  Also received XRT, but no CAD or valvular disease.  Would obtain MRI to assess degree of LGE and quantitate LVEF/RVEF.  Outside tachyarrhythmia likely SVT, but since unable to rule out VT agree with plans for EP study.  However, would like to optimize hemodynamic status for another day or so before procedure.  If needs device now or if no improvement of EF on medical therapy, excellent candidate for CRT-D.  Recommendations re HF therapy as noted above.  Would also recommend follow-up in HF clinic and at least short-term disability from work.  Absolute alcohol and smoking cessation.

Brief history of current health status/comorbidities: Per LMR, 50 year old woman with history of alcohol use s/p bilateral breast CA with her last round of chemotherapy in 2012 now with new diagnosis of decompensated biventricular failure. Please refer to medical record for complete medical hx. 


Patient's/Family's understanding of illness/diagnosis: Pt with an excellent understanding of her illness. She reports that she has heart failure and that it is unclear as to whether it is alcohol induced or chemotherapy induced or a combination. She understands that if it is alcohol induced and she continues alcohol cessation that her heart may recover, however, if it is chemotherapy induced, her heart will not recover. She would like to move forward with ICD placement this admission. She states "At least I know I don't have cancer again".


Patient's/Family's goals of care: Pt is "panicky" at baseline and is hopeful to move forward with ICD placement this admission as a means of addressing her worry and concern about returning home on medication only.


Mental health history: No formal mental health history, though pt notes that she is "panicky" and presents as tearful and anxious today. Receptive to NASW referral which sw provided to pt. No SI/HI.


Alcohol/tobacco/substance history: Pt with a history of social alcohol use, and heavy alcohol use correlated to the ending of a relationship with her ex. She ntoes that this increased use was an attempt at coping, but has good insight into why this was not effective. She has not had a drink since June and intends on continuing cessation with the help of AA and friends who attend AA. She denies any cravings or withdrawal. Pt previously smoked tobacco but quit in June as well 2/2 Chantix. No current cravings. Pt smokes marajuana daily with no intentions of quitting. She typically smokes once/day in the evening before bed or before watching a movie. She snorted cocain ~2.5 years ago with an ex, but has not used since then. No hx of IVDU.


Abuse/DV history: Pt reports an emotionally tolling relationship with her ex who cheated on her during her breast cancer treatment, but does not cite current concerns of abuse and feels safe at home.


Advanced Directives/HC Proxy: Pt's brother is HCP and son is secondary. Confirmed with pt today and located copy in medical record. 


Other risks and concerns:


Additional Info:  Assessment 

Narrative:  Mrs. Reddoch is a 49 year old woman who presents today sitting up in bed, A+Ox3, tearful and engaging with social work. Pt recounts the events of her hospitalization, stating that she is hopeful that she will have an ICD placed as she believes this would alleviate significant anxiety she feels regarding going home medically managed. She notes that she has anxiety at baseline which she describes as "panicky" and after long discussion with social work today, is open to referral to NASW for community support. She notes that she typically relies on her family and friends for support and smokes marajuana daily which helps decrease her anxiety. She finds all of these coping mechanisms to be useful, but notes that she may find it helpful to receive therapy from a professional source. 


Pt spent time discussing her alcohol use which she notes became increased after her significant other ended their relationship, but she states that she has chosen not to drink since June for self-care/health reasons and has not had cravings or withdrawal symptoms since then. She has found it easy to abstain with the help of a friend who is an active AA member for 7+ years and reports that she intends on accompanying her friend to AA once discharged to ensure abstinence. 


Pt is very much looking forward to discharging home soon. She is anxious to return to her garden and familiar environment where she hopes to recover quickly and return to work.

Name: REDDOCH,TERESA 

MRN: 29513843(BWH) 

Date: July 22, 2014 


Reason for Consultation 

Cardiomyopathy 


History of Present Illness 

Patient Reddoch is a 49 year old woman with a history of breast cancer who presents with new nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Briefly, the patient was in her usual state of health until approximately 2-3 months ago when she developed worsening fatigue and shortness of breath. She was evaluated at MetroWest, where a chest CT revealed a new right sided pleural effusion. This was tapped but the cytology was negative. The patient was eventually admitted to MetroWest on 07/14/14 for recurrence of fluid, and during that hospitalization an echo showed a new impaired systolic function of 10%. Her hospitalization was also significant for a run of VT on the day of transfer to BWH. She was loaded with amiodarone and subsequently broke with cardioversion. Since arriving here, she has not had any arrhythmias on telemetry. The patient went to cardiac cath which was non-obstructive. A repeat TTE here showed an EF of 17%. The Arrhythmia Service was consulted regarding evaluation and management of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with evidence of arrhythmias. 


On examination today, the patient is visibly nervous regarding her recent history of arrhythmia. She endorses prior episodes of palpitations at home over the last two months, at least two of which were associated with dizziness. She endorses a history of alcohol use but hasn't drank since she's felt ill. The patient denies any ongoing shortness of breath, chest pain, diaphoresis, lower extremity edema, nausea/vomiting, or weight loss/gain.

Imaging Studies 

TTE (07/19/14) - The left ventricle is mildly dilated. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness. The calculated LVEF via the method of Simpson is severely reduced at 17%. There is global hypokinesis. No left ventricular thrombus is detected. The right ventricular size is borderline enlarged. Global RV systolic function is low normal. There is moderate left atrial enlargement. The right atrium is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is structurally normal and trileaflet. There is apical displacement of the mitral valve closure pattern consistent with mitral valve tethering and/or a dilated left ventricle. Mild mitral regurgitation is present. Mild to moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation is present. The tricuspid regurgitant velocity is 2.62 m/s, and with an assumed right atrial pressure of 10.0 mmHg, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal at 37.5 mmHg.

Cath (07/21/14) - Normal coronary anatomy with elevated filling pressures

Normal sinus rhythm with LBBB 


Assessment/Recommendations 

Patient Reddoch is a 49 year old woman with a history of breast cancer, including previous chemotherapy with adriamycin and XRT to both breasts, as well as EtOH abuse who presents with new non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. EP is consulted regarding the utility of ICD implantation with or without CRT. In terms of primary prevention, the patient is just now starting optimal medical therapy and has the potential to improve. In this situation, we would typically recommend a LifeVest until her TTE can be repeated in three months. However, there is the question of whether or not the patient has had VT this hospitalization. The ECGs and telemetry strips from MetroWest were reviewed today, and what was available was not consistent with VT but rather an SVT with her native conduction delays. Without any evidence of VT, there is no indication for secondary prevention of VT with an ICD. That said, we recommend getting additional ECGs from MetroWest that may correspond with the events on 07/18/14. Separately, the patient could also be considered for CRT therapy, but as stated above, time should be given for improvement with medical therapy alone. 


In summary, the Arrhythmia Service recommends: 

- Stop amiodarone today in the absence of VT at BWH or previously at MetroWest 

- Obtain all available ECGs from MetroWest that correspond with her episodes of tachycardia 

- Obtain TTE from 2011 prior to the patient's most recent diagnosis of breast cancer 

- We will consider LifeVest now with CRT-D at a later date versus CRT-D this hospitalization, this will be discussed after the above additional date is obtained 

- Continue maximum medical therapy by titrating her BB to HR 60 and using ACE/ARB as able 


The patient was discussed and seen with the Arrhythmia Service attending, Dr. Albert. Please page the EP fellow on call with any additional questions.

EP Attending Note:  


History and physical exam as outlined above in Dr.Reddochs note. Patient seen and examined. ECGs and rhythm strips reviewed. Additional handwritten note in medical record. As above, 49-year-old woman with history of breast cancer with previous Adriamycin chemotherapy for breast cancer in 1996 with normal EF after treatment by her report, past history of heavy alcohol use but denies recent use, who presents with three-month history of progressive dyspnea on exertion and exertional lightheadedness. Found to have a nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an LVEF 10 to 15%. Also had a cardioversion at an outside hospital for wide complex tachycardia, not responsive to amiodarone. EKGs available from MetroWest are most consistent with SVT with aberrancy, but it appears that we do not have all of the EKG strips. We will gather further information as described above, but would discontinue amiodarone at present since no definitive evidence for ventricular tachycardia. Depending upon further review of the ECGs, we may decide to proceed with an ICD for secondary prevention if ventricular tachycardia can not be completely excluded. Even though cardiomyopathy is recently diagnosed, by history, she likely had symptoms for at least three months and a clear reversible cause has not been documented. If we do proceed with ICD, given her wide left bundle branch block on EKG, she likely will benefit from CRT.  All of these issues were discussed with the patient, and we will follow-up with a final plan after further information is available.

Chief Complaint:  dyspnea 


HPI: 50 year old woman with history of alcohol use s/p bilateral breast CA with her last round of chemotherapy in 2012 now with new diagnosis of decompensated biventricular failure. She underwent two rounds of chemotherapy for R sided breast Ca in 1996 (reportedly cytoxan, Adriamycin, 5FU as well as radiation) and then subsequently had left breast cancer diagnosd via MRI in 2011. She was found to be BRCA positive, estrogen, progesterone and HER 2 negative. She was treated with Eribulin Mesylate (tongue swelling with Taxol and Taxotere). Her last chemotherapy was in Spring 2012 and since then she reports having chronic fatigue that eventually resolved. She has been limited by a large R sided effusion which underwent thoracentesis 7/12/2014 and provided symptomatic relief but her symptoms recurred within 2 days. At OSH in Natick, she was found in decompensated volume overload, and TTE revealed LVEF of 10% with biventricular failure but I have not viewed either the report or images. She was started on an ARB and beta blocker and noted to have a LBBB with no available comparisons. Her course was also complicated by intermittent runs of VT and eventually a run of reported narrow complex tachycardia (again, I have yet to find rhythm strips to review) resistant to adenosine, requiring cardioversion and amiodarone. Based on her overall clinical picture, in discussion with Dr. Vic Desai in Natick, she ws transferred to the Brigham for further evaluation 


ROS: She denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, presyncope or weight loss. Otherwise negative in detail.

ASSESSMENT: 49 yo woman with new biventricular dilated cardiomyopathy. Most likely etiology is chemotherapeutic agents including adriamycin. Alcohol could contribute, but she denies substantial use recently. Will need to rule out ischemic burden and other esoteric causes (thyroid, infectious such as HIV, or autoimmune). Repeat TTE here and hope for coronary angiography and RHC on Monday. In meantime will diurese; I expect she is not far from her baseline and her elevated JVP may be TR reflections rather than volume overload. Will maintain beta blockade and ARB. She is at risk for VT but her most recent cardioversion likely was not due to sustained VT. EP consult will be helpful in the long term to determine need for ICD, but will need to exonerate coronary disease first and any other reversible causes. For now, will maintain amiodarone. We will confer with her outpatient oncologists for breast cancer prognosis, as this would be important for any discussions in the future for advanced mechanical assist devices or transplant. Finally, we will consult with the cardiooncology team to determine any further recommendation and long-term followup.

Chief Complaint:  Evaluation for cardiomyopathy 


HPI: (Obtained from OSH transfer notes and discussion with Dr.Laguarda) 


Ms. Reddoch is a 50 year old woman s/p bilateral breast CA with her last round of chemotherapy in 2012. She is presenting for evaluation of new cardiomyopathy. 


She underwent two rounds of chemotherapy for R sided breast Ca in 1996 (reportedly cytoxan, Adriamycin, 5FU as well as radiation) and then subsequently had left breast cancer diagnosd via MRI in 2011. She was found to be BRCA positive, estrogen, progesterone and HER 2 negative. She was treated with Eribulin Mesylate (tongue swelling with Taxol and Taxotere). Her last chemotherapy was in Spring 2012 and since then she reports having chronic fatigue that eventually resolved. About 3 months ago, she started experiencing significant shortness of breath with minimal exertion, trouble laying flat to sleep at night, intermittent breathlessness and increasing abdominal girth. She initially attributed her symptoms to seasonal allergies but their persistence became concerning to her. 


She set up a visit with Dr.Laguarda at Metrowest (new PCP) who pursued a CT Chest to evaluate for recurrent malignancy. The CT did show a large R sided effusion which yielded 500cc straw colored fluid lymphocytic predominance, low LDH, negative cytology. This was done on 7/12/2014 and provided symptomatic relief but her symptoms recurred within 2 days. She became significantly limited in her activities of daily living and her son got concerned enough about her to bring her to the Metrowest ED on 7/14/2014.  


Metrowest Course: She was initially diuresed with Lasix 20mg IV as needed and after her echo revealed an EF of 10% with biventricular failure, she was started on an ARB. She was noted to have a LBBB on EKG with no available comparisons. Her course was also complicated by intermittent runs of VT and eventually a run of narrow complex tachycardia resistatn to adenosine and initially amiodarone. She required cardioversion with stabilization in her pressures. Based on her overall clinical picture, in discussion with Dr.Desai, she ws transferred to the Brigham for ischemic evaluation, evaluation for possible ICD and CHF consultation.    


She denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain or weight loss over the course of this illness or previously

ASSESSMENT: 49 year old female with history of bilateral breast cancer s/p chemotherapy including adriamycin and new cardiomyopathy. Considerations as to the etiology of cardiomyopathy include a chemotherapy related toxicity vs ischemia given LBBB of inderteminate age. It will be prudent to pursue evaluation for both ischemic and non-ischemic causes at this time.  

# New Cardiomyopathy: Possible etiologies include ischemia vs chemotherapy mediated given previous exposures. Course complicated by ventricular tachycardia requiring defibrillation. At this time appears euvolemic. 

Diagnostically: 

- LHC to exonerate possible CAD given LBBB of unclear age.  

- Routine work-up for NICM: A1c, Lipid panel, Iron studies, TSH, HIV, Hepatitis Screen, CK 

- Will upload OSH 2d Echo images and attempt contacting her oncology providers for previous echos 

Therapeutically: 

- Preload: Currently euvolemic, had been intermittently diuresed with 20mg IV lasix 

- Afterload: Coreg 3.125mg 

- Arrhythmia: Continue Amiodarone 200 BID, s/p 150mg bolus prior to transfer, Ativan for anxiety, beta blocker as above.  

    - Will need to assess plan for life vest if there is any possibility of recovery vs CRT/ICD (underlying LBBB with QRS > 150)  Electrolyte repletion 

- Neurohumoral: Holding off on initiation of ACEi/ARB +/- Spironolactone pending further work-up  


Other Medical Issues: 

- History of Breast Ca: Will need breast examination this admission. 

- Seasonal allergies: Not on any outpatient medications 

- ? reactive airway: Initially treated with inhaled steroids as part of evaluation for shortness of breath but has since been off.

Dear Dr. Rapa and Glenn: 


I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Rolando Alvarez, today in the Arrhythmia Clinic at Brigham and Women's Hospital.  As you well know, the patient is a delightful 74-year-old gentleman with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure.  His ejection fraction has been as low as 15% and he has class III heart failure.  He was recently in the hospital with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response.  He was begun on amiodarone and underwent a TEE-guided cardioversion.  The patient decided to stop the amiodarone since he thought it was making him short of breath after only a few days.  He had a catheterization in 02/2010, which showed no obstructive coronary disease but significant pulmonary hypertension.  An echo at that time revealed left atrial enlargement at 5 cm and EF of 15% with mild LVH and severe global dysfunction.  He had 2-3+ MRA and increased right heart pressures. 


His past medical history is significant for his cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, alcoholic cirrhosis, pulmonary hypertension, gout, and hypertension. 


His current medications are allopurinol 300, carvedilol 12.5 b.i.d., aspirin, Lasix 40, and spironolactone 50.  Lisinopril caused a cough. 


His family history is non-significant for coronary disease, cardiomyopathy, or sudden death.  He is currently retired, denies tobacco use, drinks 1 cup of coffee a day, and drinks 4 beers a night even though he is advised to decrease this.  Today in clinic, his blood pressure is 97/75 and his pulse was 80 and regular.  His EKG revealed sinus rhythm with delayed AV conduction and an incomplete left bundle-branch block and a QRS duration of 144 milliseconds. 


In summary, the patient is a delightful 74-year-old with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, class III heart failure, and a left bundle intraventricular conduction delay.  We discussed at length the role of primary prevention defibrillator therapy in patients with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure.  We also discussed the role of biventricular pacing.  I believe that the patient would be a candidate for both, and after discussing this with the patient and his daughter, they are in agreement.  We will therefore make arrangements for this in the near future. 


Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this interesting and delightful patient.  Please do not hesitate to call with any further questions. 


Sincerely,

Rolando Alvarez 

DOB:  7-3-35 


BWH FOLLOW-UP VISIT 


Chief Complaint:  Hospital followup. 


History of Present Illness:  Rolando Alvarez is a 74 year old gentleman with a nonischemic cardiomyopathy.  The patient has been evaluated recently by Dr. Desai for consideration of ICD therapy.  The patient did undergo cardiac catheterization on 02/11/10 at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, those results demonstrated nonobstructive coronary disease.  The gentleman had a right heart catheterization, which did demonstrate fairly significant pulmonary hypertension.  His pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 61/34 mmHg with a mean pressure of 45 mmHg.  A cardiac index measured by the Fick method was 1.71 L/min per meter square.  The patient's catheterization was uneventful at that point. 


Following day the patient states that he was getting progressively more short of breath with some peripheral ankle edema.  His Lasix dose was increased from previous dose of 20 mg every other day to 40 mg once daily.  The patient had significant renal insufficiency with a GFR of 34 cc and did get a lot of fluid in anticipation of his diagnostic cath. 


This past weekend the patient was seen in the emergency department for some right groin pain.  They treated and released the gentleman and there was no pathology noted. 


Currently the patient states he feels much better.  His shortness of breath has gone.  He is not having PND or orthopnea.  There is no complaint of pedal edema.  He is not having chest pain nor palpitations.  His EKG however today does demonstrate atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate of approximately 100 beats per minute.  The incomplete left bundle branch block is present as compared to previous examination.  However the atrial fibrillation is clearly a new finding for the patient. 


Past Medical History: 

1)  Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF by echo 02/01/10, 16%). 

2)  Moderately severe mitral insufficiency. 

3)  Pulmonary hypertension. 

4)  Atrial fibrillation (new onset 02/16/10). 

5)  History of congestive heart failure. 

6)  Renal insufficiency. 

7)  Gout. 

8)  Hypertension. 

9)  History of diverticulitis. 

10)  History of anemia. 

11)  History of hyperuricemia. 


Allergies:  Lisinopril, reaction cough. 


Current Medications: 

1)  Allopurinol 300 mg daily. 

2)  Aspirin 81 mg daily. 

3)  Calcitriol 0.25 mcg daily. 

4)  Diovan/hydrochlorothiazide 150/25 mg one tablet daily. 

5)  Lasix 40 mg daily. 


Social History:  The patient is retired.  He is a nonsmoker and nondrinker.  The patient is an immigrant from Bolivia. 


Family History:  Noncontributory for HPI. 


Review of Systems:  As per HPI only, otherwise review of systems is negative today. 


PE: 

General Appearance:  He is a well-developed and well-nourished gentleman, in no acute distress. 

Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 110/62 mmHg, pulse 94 irregularly irregular, respiratory rate 18 per minute, O2 sat on room air 97%, and weight 136 pounds. 

HEENT Exam:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Bilateral ear lobe creases.  Oropharynx, mucosa is wet and pink.  Sclerae are anicteric. 

Neck:  Supple.  Jugular venous pressure is approximately 12 to 14 cm.  Carotid upstroke is +2 without carotid bruit.  There is no thyromegaly.  There is no lymphadenopathy. 

Chest:  Clear to auscultation. 

Heart:  Point of maximal impulse is displaced laterally.  Normal S1/S2.  There is no S3 nor S4.  There is a 1-2/6 holosystolic murmur left lower sternal border, which radiates to left anterior axillary line. 

Abdomen:  Soft.  Bowel sounds are present.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  There is no palpable mass. 

Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Peripheral pulse is +2, bilateral and symmetrical.  Examination of the right groin reveals no evidence of bruit.  There is mild ecchymoses noted.  There is no pain to the catheterization site. 


IMPRESSION:  Rolando Alvarez is a 74 year old gentleman with a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, who recently underwent a right and left heart catheterization demonstrating no significant coronary disease, however he did have significant pulmonary hypertension.  The following day he got more short of breath and probably slipped into some congestive heart failure, which has improved on Lasix as ordered.  The patient was seen this weekend in the emergency room and released after some right groin pain, which has resolved.  His EKG today demonstrates new onset atrial fibrillation. 


RECOMMENDATIONS: 


1)  Electrolytes have been performed today to assess any possible imbalance, status post his cardiac catheterization. 

2)  The patient will need to be started on Warfarin therapy at a dose of 5 mg daily. 

3)  For a better control of ventricular response rate, the patient was started on Coreg CR 10 mg once daily. 

4)  The patient will return for cardiology followup on 02/18/10.  At that time, another EKG will be performed as well as PT/INR.

Dear Jerry: 


I reviewed Keith Regan in my Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic today.  He is 47 years of age, has a nonischemic cardiomyopathy and has wide left bundle-branch block possibly due to a familial cardiomyopathy.  Over the years, he has remained relatively asymptomatic and we have been deferring implantation of a CRT device.  However, in the last year, he has been increasingly fatigued and has some exertional dyspnea with a NYHA class II functional level.  He does not have any nocturnal dyspnea and has had no syncope. 


His current medications include carvedilol 12.5 mg in the morning and 6.25 mg in the evening and lisinopril 10 mg b.i.d. 


Today, there are no signs of overt heart failure.  Blood pressure is 128/90 and he is in sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 56. 


His 12-lead ECG shows left bundle-branch block with a QRS duration of 170 milliseconds.  Heart rate is 56 beats per minute in sinus rhythm.  PR interval is 192 milliseconds. 


Given his recent symptoms and the fact that his last echocardiogram from March 2013 showed an ejection fraction of 30-35% with global LV dysfunction, I think it is reasonable to proceed with a CRT device to try and improve his ejection fraction.  We discussed the option of an ICD versus the pacemaker and he is adamant that he does not want ICD and he would prefer just cardiac pacing to improve ejection fraction.  I think this is not unreasonable and I will bring him in for this procedure in the next few weeks.  He should continue on his current medications unchanged. 


With kindest regards. 


Yours sincerely,

Dear Neal: 


Today, we attempted to upgrade Cornelia O'Hare's left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker to a CRT-D system.  This turned out to be exceptionally challenging procedure, which over the course of 5-1/2 hours was only partially successful.  We were able to gain access to the left subclavicular venous system with some difficulty related to venous space as a result of her small body stature and prior leads.  A preprocedural planning retrograde coronary venogram disclosed a large mid chamber lateral coronary vein, which was the initial target for left ventricular pacing, a small posterior-lateral coronary vein, which was incompletely visualized, and of course a middle cardiac vein and an anterior cardiac vein, which were not targeted for left ventricular pacing. 


Our difficulties began with coronary sinus access relating to a number of biomechanical issues, but primarily that the coronary sinus ostium had a takeoff that was perpindicular to the chest wall.  This made sheath delivery and manipulation exceptionally difficult.  It was almost impossible to manipulate the guidewire and lead within the sheath because of binding along the path of the sheath.  There is no obvious way to overcome this throughout the procedure.  Nonetheless, I was able to cannulate the mid chamber lateral coronary vein and with use of  passive fixation electrodes, and mechanically stable positions, could not eliminate phrenic nerve stimulation. 


I then turned my attention to the anterior coronary vein and was able to identify and cannulate a small anterior-lateral branch (not previously visualized), which would have been perfect for our purposes but in that location, I could not achieve left ventricular capture due to epicardial scar.  I was unable to cannulate the small posterior-lateral coronary vein again, because we had great difficulty manipulating sub-selecting catheters within the primary CS sheath.  I then additionally attempted to place an active fixation left ventricular lead in the mid chamber lateral coronary vein, but all of these maneuvers were made difficult by the early observation of a coronary sinus dissection.  Interestingly, during all of the 5 hours of work, the dissection healed spontaneously and I thought we were going to be able maneuver freely again and then it recurred with guidewire manipulation and eventually this was the reason we had to cease the procedure. 


She tolerated all this remarkably well.  She is not at risk for pericardial blood because of her adhesions after cardiac surgery as you know.  She had transient hypotension several times during the procedure related to sedation and some blood loss, but nothing of the surgical origin. 


The question now remains what to do.  We did get in a right ventricular ICD lead, so she does have a CRT-D generator with right-sided leads.  She is protected from sudden cardiac death.  The options are either: 

1.  A thoracoscopic left ventricular lead placement if the cardiac surgeon feels that it is possible given her prior cardiac surgery. 

2.  A left lateral thoracotomy for left ventricular lead placement in view of her prior cardiac surgery, or. 

3.  A second attempt at coronary venous pacing. 


I am beginning to think about the possibility of attempting another go from the shoulder and what I would do differently and would probably relate to a different set of sheath and I still would say the odds of success are only around 75%.  I cannot emphasize how difficult it was to maneuver with the main body of the coronary sinus. 


If it seems as though there is consensus on that, then I will make arrangements probably within about 4-6 weeks time. 


Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Whittredge: 


I had the pleasure of meeting Cornelia O'Hare in the Cardiovascular Clinic today.  As you know, she had a comprehensive evaluation with Dr. Neal Lakdawala on 07/10/2013, so please refer to his note for details.  She is a 65-year-old woman with cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, atrial block and congestive heart failure in the context of family history of lamin-related heart disease.  Dr. Lakdawala increased her furosemide to 120 in the morning and 80 mg in the evening from 80 mg b.i.d.  She did that for a few days, and her weight decreased slightly and remains in the 163-165 pounds range.  Today, she is 165 pounds.  Generally feels like her breathing has been better and her energy level is better.  Her activity tolerance has improved and she has been doing some cooking, driving locally  and socializing with friends.  Her lightheadedness is better.  Unfortunately, she was not able to tolerate the higher dose of furosemide because she felt that her kidney function was worsened, she cut back to 80 mg twice daily again. 


Review of systems is negative for orthopnea, abdominal bloating, lower extremity edema.  She has had no presyncope.  Her ICD has not gone off. 


Her medication list was reconciled today and includes: 

Allopurinol 300 MG (300 MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD 

Amitriptyline Hcl 30 MG (10 MG TABLET Take 3) PO QHS

On physical exam, she is a middle-aged woman who is slightly short of breath getting up on the exam table by herself.  Blood pressure 130/70 in the right arm sitting, heart rate 76 and regular, and a weight of 166 pounds (up 3 pounds since her last visit 07/10/2013).  Her oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.  There was no scleral icterus or conjunctival pallor.  Her neck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Her mucous membranes are moist.  Her jugular venous pressures are elevated at 12-14 cm of water with prominent V waves.  There is a single S1 and physiological split S2.  I did not appreciate a murmur, rub, or gallop.  Her abdomen is obese and soft.  There is no tenderness or hepatomegaly.  There is a surgical scar below the umbilicus.  Extremities are warm without edema.  Her mood is subdued. 


I did not repeat a 12-lead ECG today.

In summary. Ms Ohare is here for follow up after increase in her furosemide by Dr. Lakdawala on 7/10/13. She shows evidence of fluid overload and her clinic weight is up 3 lbs since her last appointment. She initially lost a few pounds with the increase of furosemide from 80 mg bid to 120 mg am/80 mg pm but tells me that her creatinine climbed to 1.9 so she cut back. Her renal function is at baseline today. Although she did not lose any fluid weight, her breathing and energy level have improved so I made no changes to her medications. She has a visit this morning with Dr. Michael Sweeney to discuss upgrade of her ICD to biventricular pacemaker. 


She has follow up with Dr. Lakdawala in Heart Failure Clinic on  November 15th, 2013 or sooner if needed. 


Please contact me for questions and concerns.  


Best regards,

Dear Colleagues: 


I met with Cornelia O'Hare today to discuss a potential upgrade of her dual-chamber pacemaker system to a CRT-D system in the context of cardiomyopathy, AV block, heart failure with a family history of lamin-related heart disease. 


Her history has been very carefully outlined by Dr. Lakdawala as recently as 07/10/2013 and need not be summarized. 


She has had aortic root replacement and a bioprosthetic aortic valve combined with a Maze procedure for atrial fibrillation in 2007.  I believe as a consequence of that, she ended up with a dual-chamber pacemaker.  Her left ventricular function has hovered in the mildly reduced range with an ejection fraction of about 40-45% with mild left ventricular enlargement.  More recently, she has developed symptoms of heart failure, and she is of course subjected to continuous right ventricular pacing. 


Her current medications evidently are allopurinol, Coumadin, Lasix, metoprolol, and potassium. 


She has a St. Jude model 5826 pacing system, which we reviewed today.  She is in atrial fibrillation, but she is not pacemaker dependent; her ventricular response during atrial fibrillation is relatively fixed at about 40 beats per minute, which basically condemns to her to continuous right ventricular stimulation.  Ventricular lead parameters are stable at 0.75/0.5/566/5.3 millivolts or greater; atrial lead stimulation threshold could not be determined because she is in atrial fibrillation, but lead impedance is in the normal range.  Battery impedance is 1.5, anticipating 2.5-3 years of continued useful service or a bit longer.  No ventricular arrhythmia has been recorded by her pacemaker. 


There is a profound family history of sudden death in the context of cardiomyopathy, all which has been outlined in Dr. Lakdawala's correspondence. 


The question that was posed for us today is could we navigate upgrade to a CRT-D system for: 

1.  Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. 

2.  Ventricular resynchronization to address her slowly declining left ventricular pump function and symptoms of systolic heart failure in the context of LBBB physiology due to obligatory RV pacing. 


I do know this family, and I have treated some members of this family already. 


We therefore spent the majority of our time today discussing the surgical approach to upgrade as described above.  This includes the possibility of left subclavian or axillary venoplasty, and more remotely, the possibility of a thoracotomy or limited thorascopic approach to epicardial left ventricular pacing if we cannot achieve a suitable result using the coronary veins. 


All of her questions were addressed today.  She is interested in proceeding with the device upgrade.  It is now a matter of a mutually agreeable time, which we will begin to work out over the next several days over the phone.  I will be in touch regarding arrangements and outcomes. 


Sincerely,

Contact: 


Reason for Admission: BiV upgrade 


History of the Present Illness: 

55 year old with history of CHF (EF 20% August 2011 NYHA III) who presents for Bi V upgrade. 


He was first noticed to have enlargement of his heart in 1993 when he was found to have a pneumothorax secondary to blebs.   In 2001 he had PVCs and exertional dyspnea and an implantable defribillator was inserted. He had cardiac catheterization in 2004 with normal right heart pressures.  His echo is 2007 showed LV EF of 20 %.  In 2009 he had a stress test that showed good exercise for 5 minutes.  There were no changes diagnostic for ischemia 


In 2011 he had a significant decline in exercise capacity.  He now has dyspnea with grocery shopping and other ADLs. He notes occasional orthopnea.  He is short of breath while climbing stairs.  He notes occasional ankle edema and abdominal bloating. 


His palipations have increased and was admitted in the fall after being shocked by his ICD for SVT. 


His shortness of breath continued to worsen and his lasix was increased in January.  

His palpitations have increased. He was admitted to Salem Hospital this past fall after having three shocks from his ICD. The shocks were thought to be inappropriately due to supraventricular tachycardia.

Mr. Swain's most recent cardiopulmonary exercise test on December 9, 2011, showed a peak oxygen consumption of 18.9 mL/kg per minute. His ventilatory efficiency was 39. There is a secondary pulmonary limit to exercise, though he did have an early anaerobic threshold on the study consistent with a cardiac limit to exercise. Radionuclide imaging showed a baseline RV ejection fraction of 37% that fell to 33% with exercise. 


He is coming in today for BiV upgrade, after pacer interrogation showed he was pacing a significant amount of the time and had a prolongued QRS.

Dear Colleagues:

 Gary returned today for a followup visit. He underwent initial part of the heart transplant evaluation. His coronary arteries were normal as expected. He is feeling significantly better since his Toprol was cut back from 150 to 100 mg daily. During his hospitalization, his blood pressure suggested that he would be able to tolerate higher dose of vasodilator, so his Diovan was increased. So far he has been able to tolerate this.

His palpitations are better. He sleeps on one pillow. His weight has been stable.


Medications:
1. Diovan 80 mg daily (increased).
2. Fioricet one tablet q.4 h. p.r.n.
3. Hydroxyzine 50 mg q.6 h. as needed.
4. Lasix 40 mg daily.
5. Pravastatin 20 mg daily.
6. Reglan 10 mg daily.
7. Spironolactone 12.5 mg daily.
8. Toprol-XL 100 mg daily.
9. Valtrex as needed.

Physical Exam 
General Shows a trim, slightly overweight, well-appearing gentleman.
BP 118/68 
Pulse 70 and regular
weight ____
Heent Unremarkable. He had no scleral icterus.
Neck Veins were not elevated. Carotid upstrokes were brisk.
Chest Clear.
Cardiac Showed a diffuse and laterally displaced PMI. He had a soft third heart sound. No murmur.
Abdomen Slightly obese. No organomegaly.
Extremities Showed no edema.

 EKG:
 Normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, IVCD, nonspecific ST and T-wave abnormalities.

 Impression:
 Gary appears to be euvolemic at this point. His energy level is better on the lower dose of beta-blocker, hopefully he will tolerate the higher dose of vasodilator.

He is scheduled to return for biventricular pacer upgrade next week, although his QRS is not dramatically wide (around 130 milliseconds), he does pace a fair amount of time from his defibrillator and it is felt that this may be worsening his heart failure symptoms. Hopefully that will improve his functional capacity this summer.

I have made no changes to his program. I have told him that we will see how he does with the biventricular pacer. Hopefully, that upgrade will improve his functional capacity and avoid the need for transplant listing for considerable amount of time. We will see how things evolve. Thanks to all three for your help in sorting out the best step in his management at this stage.

Problems: 
Heart failure. - We have discussed the physiology of the electrical conduction system and pathophysiologic basis of heart failure progression. We have discussed the potential upgrade of his device to a biventricular ICD for the treatment of heart failure. We have reviewed that not all patients respond; however, believe he is a good candidate. We have reviewed that we will discuss this option with you and if in agreement, we will discuss proceeding. We have reviewed pre and post-procedure expectations, success rates, and procedure risks including, but not limited to infection, hematoma, bleeding, pain, vascular complications, pericardial effusion and tamponade, potential need for laser lead extraction and device upgrade, inability to implant the CS lead, stroke, heart attack, pneumothorax and death. Mr. Swain understands and is in agreement. We have discussed that we would recommend adding an atrial and coronary sinus lead and leaving the existing RV lead. We will discuss the plan with you and if you are in agreement, we will discuss proceeding.

Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. - Mr. Swain certainly has significant dilated cardiomyopathy. He does seem to not tolerate higher doses of beta-blocker, therefore, we will not increase that. There may well be room to increase his Valsartan to help improve his cardiac function. I have asked him to follow his home blood pressures and we will be seeing him in several days to evaluate whether we can increase to 80 mg a day.
In terms of the transplant evaluation, it seems reasonable to proceed with the initiation of a transplant evaluation given the decline in Mr. Swain's exercise capacity. Nonetheless, his cardiopulmonary exercise test result does suggest that his prognosis is better than the patients that we usually consider for cardiac transplantation. On the other hand, his significant fall in exercise capacity over the last several months is worrisome. He also describes a fairly poor quality of life because of his palpitations and this is a consideration as well in terms of his transplant candidacy..
Mr. Swain has agreed to proceed with cardiac transplant evaluation and signed a consent form. We will initiate the evaluation with a right heart catheterization to assess his hemodynamics and for the presence of secondary pulmonary hypertension. In addition, he has fairly severe hyperlipidemia and I think it is worth assuring that he does not have significant coronary artery disease. I doubt the latter is likely, but given his history, it is worth definitively excluding with a cor angiogram.
Also contributing to the considerations for cardiac transplantation in this gentleman is the fact that there is a possibility of some improvement in cardiac function with the initiation of resynchronization therapy. There is also the possibility of improvement in his arrhythmia as well. Therefore, while we will initiate the transplant evaluation with the catheterization, it is unlikely that we will come to a definitive decision prior to his planned implantation of a resynchronization device. In addition, there may well be a modest amount of improvement by increasing his Valsartan dose.

Diagnosis
 Primary Diagnosis: Dilated Myopathy: Idiopathic ; 

 Past medical history:
 In 1993, he developed a pneumothorax, which was thought to be a result of pulmonary blebs. Workup at that time showed enlargement of his heart. In 1999, he had palpitations and syncope. His exercise capacity at that time remained excellent and he was a competitive sailor. He was also noted again to have cardiac dilatation and was begun on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitor.
In 2001, he was noted to have frequent PVCs as well as exertional dyspnea. An implantable defibrillator was placed. 
In 2004 a cardiac catheterization revealed normal right heart pressures. He did not have a left heart catheterization. He underwent a transplant evaluaiton and he was found to be too well and continued with medical therapy. 
In 2007, an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 20%. He had a cardiopulmonary exercise test that showed a peak oxygen consumption of 30.1 mL/kg per minute. He continued on his medical regimen and remained quite active. 
In 2009, his echocardiographic LV ejection fraction was 25% with a left ventricular end-diastolic diameter of 66 mm. He had normal right ventricular function. He also had a stress test, which showed he could exercise for 5 minutes and 20 seconds. There were patchy inhomogeneities in his radionuclide tracer uptake, but no changes diagnostic for ischemia.
In 2011, he noted a significant deterioration in his exercise capacity. He found that he was no longer able to participate in competitive sailing to the extent that he would like. He was admitted to Salem Hospital this past fall after having three shocks from his ICD. The shocks were thought to be inappropriately due to supraventricular tachycardia.
n January 2012, his shortness of breath increased and his Lasix was increased. Consideration has been made of implantation of a biventricular pacemaker, as his QRS is modestly widened. He has also been advised to consider cardiac transplantation.
His most recent cardiopulmonary exercise test on December 9, 2011, showed a peak oxygen consumption of 18.9 mL/kg per minute. His ventilatory efficiency was 39. There is a secondary pulmonary limit to exercise, though he did have an early anaerobic threshold on the study consistent with a cardiac limit to exercise. Radionuclide imaging showed a baseline RV ejection fraction of 37% that fell to 33% with exercise.

Diagnosis
 Primary Diagnosis: Dilated Myopathy: Idiopathic ; 

 Past medical history:
 In 1993, he developed a pneumothorax, which was thought to be a result of pulmonary blebs. Workup at that time showed enlargement of his heart. In 1999, he had palpitations and syncope. His exercise capacity at that time remained excellent and he was a competitive sailor. He was also noted again to have cardiac dilatation and was begun on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitor.
In 2001, he was noted to have frequent PVCs as well as exertional dyspnea. An implantable defibrillator was placed. 
In 2004 a cardiac catheterization revealed normal right heart pressures. He did not have a left heart catheterization. He underwent a transplant evaluaiton and he was found to be too well and continued with medical therapy. 
In 2007, an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 20%. He had a cardiopulmonary exercise test that showed a peak oxygen consumption of 30.1 mL/kg per minute. He continued on his medical regimen and remained quite active.

 Sheelagh Nelis, fiance 902-403-3094 
Involved MGH Professionals: Cardiac Transplant Team

REASON FOR REFERRAL:
Evaluation for heart transplant

SOURCES OF INFORMATION:
Patient

PERSONAL HISTORY:
Pt was born and raised in Marblehead, MA, but he has lived in a number of other parts of the US (Kansas, Texas, Colorado and Virginia). Pt plans to be married to Sheelagh Nelis, 42yo, on 9/1/12 aboard the Nirvana in Marblehead Harbor. 

Pt_s father died ~19 years ago of a massive coronary. He had a history of CAD, CABG. Pt_s mother (Sylvia Swain, 76yo) lives in North Conway, NH. She is a nurse practitioner who still works part-time. Her fianc, Gordon Brown, age 80, is also supportive. Pt_s sister, Amanda Sylvester, 50yo, is married, has no children, lives in Salem, MA. Pt says she _tends to run on emotions_. They have a close relationship, and she brought him to the hospital. Another sister (Christina) died of SIDS.

Pt_s ex-wife Tammy Smith (58yo) is an artist to whom he was married for 1 year prior to their divorce in 1986. Pt has had no recent contact with her. They have one daughter, Halsey (27yo) who lives in Portland, OR, and pt has occasional phone calls with her.

Pt reports he has many friends who are supportive: JB Nayduch in Marblehead (781-639-0105).
Emma Cataldi (978-468-7803). Michael Brown is a cousin and film producer. Kelly Parkins is a friend who had a heart transplant and then climbed The Matterhorn, pt_s _mentor_.

EDUCATIONAL AND VOCATIONAL HISTORY:
Pt has his Masters in Management from Cambridge College and has worked as a hospital executive administering inpatient psychiatric units. He has also worked on swordfishing boats, including the Andrea Gail. He said he did this primarily to get away from his ex-wife, but he has since been a consultant on _The Perfect Storm_ movie and has been interviewed on television on this topic. Pt said he joined the Army because he wanted to be on their shooting team, the best in the world. He did so in July 1975 and also made the Olympic team as a competitive rifle shooter, but the US boycotted the Olympics in 1980 so he did not get to compete. Pt has also produced blues festivals for years in New England (including Newport Jazz Festival and Salem, MA). Pt sometimes works as executive producer with his cousins (Michael, Gordie and Nick Brown) making documentaries in their family business.

IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT_S FUNCTIONING:
Pt is finding it very difficult to experience restricted activity tolerance. He states he enjoys extreme physical activity such as mountain climbing, offshore ocean racing, and downhill skiing. He had adapted from participating in sailing to directing others onboard the boat. He says a serious goal for himself is to climb Mt. Everest after his heart transplant. His friend, Kelly Parkins, has climbed Mount Kilamonjaro in the past and The Matterhorn after her heart transplant, and he considers her his mentor. 

FINANCES, INSURANCE AND MEDICATIONS:
Pt has been on SSDI retroactive to 4/1/00 due to cardiomyopathy. Pt plans to ask a friend, who had heart transplant and is now sponsored by a pharmaceutical company to climb mountains in various parts of the world, how he can make a similar arrangement as he would like to sail around the world. He is a Vietnam-Era Veteran, so he will inquire about obtaining prescriptions through the Veterans Administration.

FAMILY SUPPORTS AND CONCERNS:
Pt lives alone in Marblehead, MA. His fiance, Sheelagh Nelis, is moving from Nova Scotia to live with him soon, and they plan to be married in September. Pt_s sister lives in Salem, MA, but pt says it may be difficult for her emotionally to be involved in pt_s care. Pt_s mother is in North Conway, NH, and is a nurse practitioner who works part-time and may be able to provide assistance. 

COPING STYLES:
Pt copes by keeping busy and physically active. He feels he _fell off a cliff_ at the end of October 2011 when his defibrillator fired 3 times while he was out on his boat. He managed to return to port and went to the hospital, but he is distressed by changes in his condition (fatigue, sleeps 12-18 hours/day, no appetite, retaining fluid). He was filmed climbing a 14,000-foot mountain in Challenge for Life, although he was severely short of breath at the finish, but he does not plan to do that again until after transplant. He has done some high-risk activities such as bungee jumping from the French King Bridge at night. Pt says, _I love freedom. I don_t want to be sick._ When pt finds an activity, he delves into it. Pt reports being depressed after his lung surgery when his girlfriend broke up with him and his father had died the fall before, and he thinks he should have been on antidepressant medication at that time. Pt has many friends who are doing exciting things all around the world, and he copes at times by keeping track of everyone and how they are doing. He was raised Methodist but does not participate in organized religion at this time. He finds spirituality in a beautiful sunrise or sunset, emotional events in the lives of friends and family members, and nature. He feels sadness that someone will die for him to receive donor heart, but he is grateful for that gift. He has been a speaker for Guidant, educating others who were about to have the device about how he has continued to be physically active. Pt has begun to change his diet and limit sodium intake, and he is considering modifying his habit of drinking gallon of whole milk daily.

HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE/TREATMENT:
Pt smoked ~1ppd and quit in 1991 after 16 years of smoking. He quit drinking alcohol to focus on preparation for the Olympics, drank to the point of blackout one time in the Army, drank wine occasionally beginning in 1983. He not has 1-2 glasses of wine 1-2 times/week. Pt smoked marijuana and snorted cocaine occasionally for recreational use but quit when ~21yo because it made him feel a little paranoid and he did not like the feeling. Pt says his grandfather was an alcoholic who knew Bill Wilson in the early days of AA. Pt_s father was an alcoholic who quit drinking but ended up not going to meetings and a _dry drunk_.

PATIENT ATTITUDE TOWARD TRANSPLANT:
When pt was interviewed for heart transplant evaluation in 2004, he was concerned about when he would get listed and the ramifications for his lifestyle (i.e., _The leash they put on you so you no longer have freedom._) He now realizes that he is not able to do much as he is now, so the restrictions are not great when compared to the possibility of heart transplant and improved lifestyle afterwards. 

ASSESSMENT:
Pt is motivated for transplant and is acknowledging that the time is close when he will need heart transplant. Pt has identified a history of severe depression when he thinks medication would have been helpful. Continued assessment of his mood and emotional support will be needed.

EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES:

0MGH Social Services _Putting the Pieces Together_
0MGH Resources
0brochures for NFT/Help Hope Live re: assistance with fundraising for transplant-related expenses

PLAN:
Pt will clarify medical insurance coverage with Khalid Abdi, MGH Transplant Financial Coordinator, and apply for MassHealth, if necessary. Pt will work on fundraising to help with transplant-related expenses. SW will remain available to pt and family for support and referrals as needed.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

RE: I was asked to see this 55-year-old man with cardiomyopathy for consideration of cardiac transplantation.


 Mr. Swain was very active as a young adult. In 1993, he developed a pneumothorax, which was thought to be a result of pulmonary blebs. Workup at that time showed enlargement of his heart. In 1999, he had palpitations and syncope. His exercise capacity at that time remained excellent and he was a competitive sailor. He was also noted again to have cardiac dilatation and was begun on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitor.

In 2001, he was noted to have frequent PVCs as well as exertional dyspnea. An implantable defibrillator was placed. He underwent cardiac catheterization in 2004. His right heart pressures were normal. He did not have a left heart catheterization. In 2007, he had an echocardiogram that showed an LV ejection fraction of 20%. He had a cardiopulmonary exercise test that showed a peak oxygen consumption of 30.1 mL/kg per minute. He continued on his medical regimen and remains quite active. In 2009, Mr. Swain again underwent evaluation. His echocardiographic LV ejection fraction was 25% with a left ventricular end-diastolic diameter of 66 mm. He had normal right ventricular function. He also had a stress test, which showed he could good exercise for 5 minutes and 20 seconds. There were patchy inhomogeneities in his radionuclide tracer uptake, but no changes diagnostic for ischemia.

In the fall of 2011, Mr. Swain noted a significant deterioration in his exercise capacity. He found that he was no longer able to participate in competitive sailing to the extent that he would like. This decline in his exercise capacity has progressed to the point where he now has dyspnea with carrying groceries and other ADL's. He notes occasional orthopnea. He notes that he is short of breath with climbing approximately one flight of stairs. He has occasional ankle edema at the end of the day as well as abdominal bloating. 

His palpitations have increased. He was admitted to Salem Hospital this past fall after having three shocks from his ICD. The shocks were thought to be inappropriately due to supraventricular tachycardia.

In January 2012, Mr. Swain's shortness of breath increased and his Lasix was increased. Consideration has been made of implantation of a biventricular pacemaker, as his QRS is modestly widened. He has also been advised to consider cardiac transplantation.

Mr. Swain does not currently have chest discomfort. He has not had any recent syncope. He is compliant with his medications, but less so with a low-sodium diet.

Mr. Swain's most recent cardiopulmonary exercise test on December 9, 2011, showed a peak oxygen consumption of 18.9 mL/kg per minute. His ventilatory efficiency was 39. There is a secondary pulmonary limit to exercise, though he did have an early anaerobic threshold on the study consistent with a cardiac limit to exercise. Radionuclide imaging showed a baseline RV ejection fraction of 37% that fell to 33% with exercise.

 Past medical history:
 1. ICD shocks. 
2. Question of Atrial Arrhythmias. 
3. NSVT. 
4. Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Ejection Fraction 20% with Wide QRS and Class III-IV New York Heart Association Heart Failure. 
5. Mild-to-Moderate Mitral Regurgitation. 
6. Tension Pneumothorax S/P RUL and partial RML Lobectomy in 2003.

 Assessment and plan:
 SUMMARY: We will proceed with right and left heart catheterization including coronary angiography next week. Should he have significant pulmonary hypertension, a selective pulmonary vasodilator will be administered in order to assess this.

Problems: 
Hyperlipidemia. - Mr. Swain's hyperlipidemia at last check in September was not very well controlled. I have asked him to obtain another set of fasting lipids.

Supraventricular tachycardia. - Mr. Swain does not appear to tolerate higher doses of beta-blocker. He will discuss this problem again with Dr. Mansour and Dr. Katcher.

Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. - Mr. Swain certainly has significant dilated cardiomyopathy. He does seem to not tolerate higher doses of beta-blocker, therefore, we will not increase that. There may well be room to increase his Valsartan to help improve his cardiac function. I have asked him to follow his home blood pressures and we will be seeing him in several days to evaluate whether we can increase to 80 mg a day.
In terms of the transplant evaluation, it seems reasonable to proceed with the initiation of a transplant evaluation given the decline in Mr. Swain's exercise capacity. Nonetheless, his cardiopulmonary exercise test result does suggest that his prognosis is better than the patients that we usually consider for cardiac transplantation. On the other hand, his significant fall in exercise capacity over the last several months is worrisome. He also describes a fairly poor quality of life because of his palpitations and this is a consideration as well in terms of his transplant candidacy..
Mr. Swain has agreed to proceed with cardiac transplant evaluation and signed a consent form. We will initiate the evaluation with a right heart catheterization to assess his hemodynamics and for the presence of secondary pulmonary hypertension. In addition, he has fairly severe hyperlipidemia and I think it is worth assuring that he does not have significant coronary artery disease. I doubt the latter is likely, but given his history, it is worth definitively excluding with a cor angiogram.
Also contributing to the considerations for cardiac transplantation in this gentleman is the fact that there is a possibility of some improvement in cardiac function with the initiation of resynchronization therapy. There is also the possibility of improvement in his arrhythmia as well. Therefore, while we will initiate the transplant evaluation with the catheterization, it is unlikely that we will come to a definitive decision prior to his planned implantation of a resynchronization device. In addition, there may well be a modest amount of improvement by increasing his Valsartan dose.

RE: ICD shocks.

Dear Dr. Dec:

 Problem List: 

1. ICD shocks. 
2. Question of Atrial Arrhythmias. 
3. NSVT. 
4. Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Ejection Fraction 20% with Wide QRS and Class III-IV New York Heart Association Heart Failure. 
5. Mild-to-Moderate Mitral Regurgitation. 
6. Tension Pneumothorax S/P RUL and partial RML Lobectomy in 2003. 
7. Palpitations. 
8. Hyperlipidemia. 
9. Peptic ulcer disease. 
10. BPH. 
11. Prior ETOH use. 
12. Migraines. 
13. Blebs 

We had the pleasure of meeting Gary Swain in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic referred by you for consultation due to ICD shocks. We will summarize his medical history for the sake of our records. As you know, he is a 55-year-old male with history of dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy dating back to approximately 1996. He underwent implantation of a single chamber Boston Scientific ICD in 2001 and underwent a generator change in 2009. Past medical history is otherwise significant for tension pneumothorax in 2003 followed by a RUL and partial RML Lobectomy. He has had multiple blebs with placement of chest tubes, hyperlipidemia, BPH, peptic ulcer disease and prior ETOH abuse. He does have prior history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and syncope prior to defibrillator implantation. 

Mr. Swain has received four ICD shocks since August. One was in August and three were in October 2011. Device interrogation today from those events show a tachycardia up to 380 milliseconds. The tachycardia is primarily regular and looks similar on both occasions; however not completely the same. It is difficult to see if the electrograms from his intrinsic rate today are similar to the electrograms during the tachycardia. In August, he received a shock after failed ATP and the tachycardia did not break. It eventually slowed and fell below the cut off. At that time, he did not have any symptoms prior and denied chest pain, shortness of breath, presyncope or syncope. He presented to Salem Hospital where he underwent a device interrogation and the rhythm was thought to be sinus tachycardia. In October, he was preparing a boat due to a storm that was approaching and had a shock from his device x3. He again denied any symptoms and was not exerting himself to a great extent at that time. He was thrown down because of the shocks, however, had no pre syncope or syncope. Review of the events during that time showed a similar tachycardia to that of August 2011. He received ATP prior to the ICD shocks, which was unsuccessful and then had three separate shocks, which did not break the tachycardia. The tachycardia later slowed and fell below the cut off. He presented to North Shore Medical Center and was thought to have had shocks related to either sinus tachycardia or SVT. His beta-blocker dose was increased at that time, his SVT discriminators were programmed and his therapy zone rate increased. 

Mr. Swain has not tolerated the increase in beta-blocker dosage and it was therefore, decreased. He has had problems over the last year with increasing shortness of breath at rest, exertional fatigue, intermittent PND and orthopnea, exertional shortness of breath and difficulty doing his normal activities. He had been sleeping intermittently during the day after the beta-blocker dose was increased. He is currently on Metoprolol 100 mg daily, Diovan and Lasix. He denies any chest pain, presyncope or syncope. 

EKG today shows sinus rhythm at 88 beats per minute with a QRS of 128 milliseconds. He recently underwent a cardiopulmonary stress test and his peak O2 uptake has fallen from 30 mL/kg/min to 18 mL/kg/min. He is going to be evaluated for possible cardiac transplantation.

 Other Data:
 Echocardiogram August 2011. Conclusions: Mild left atrial enlargement. Moderate LV dilatation with markedly depressed function and ejection fraction 20%. Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation. No evidence of significant dyssynchrony. Normal pulmonary artery pressures. Left atrium 40 mm, LVEDD 64 mm, LVEDS 59 mm, IVS 9 mm, PWT 9 mm and ejection fraction 20%.

 Assessment and plan:
 Mr. Swain is a 55-year-old male with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, class III-IV New York Heart Association heart failure with ejection fraction 20% and wide QRS. He is status post single chamber ICD in 2001 and generator change in 2009. He has a Boston Scientific device. He has had four ICD shocks since August. Review of EGMs from those events show a tachycardia of approximately 380 milliseconds that looks similar. He did not have symptoms during the tachycardia and ATP and ICD therapy did not break the arrhythmia on both occasions. This weighs heavily against ventricular tachycardia. It does not appear that this is sinus tachycardia and is likely an atrial arrhythmia; however, cannot completely distinguish due to single lead. He does have a history of ventricular tachycardia and has PVCs. He did not tolerate an increased dose of beta-blocker. Recent cardiopulmonary stress test showed a decline in heart function and progression of heart failure. His most recent ejection fraction was 20% in August 2011. He is being evaluated for cardiac transplantation. 

Problems: 
Heart failure. - We have discussed the physiology of the electrical conduction system and pathophysiologic basis of heart failure progression. We have discussed the potential upgrade of his device to a biventricular ICD for the treatment of heart failure. We have reviewed that not all patients respond; however, believe he is a good candidate. We have reviewed that we will discuss this option with you and if in agreement, we will discuss proceeding. We have reviewed pre and post-procedure expectations, success rates, and procedure risks including, but not limited to infection, hematoma, bleeding, pain, vascular complications, pericardial effusion and tamponade, potential need for laser lead extraction and device upgrade, inability to implant the CS lead, stroke, heart attack, pneumothorax and death. Mr. Swain understands and is in agreement. We have discussed that we would recommend adding an atrial and coronary sinus lead and leaving the existing RV lead. We will discuss the plan with you and if you are in agreement, we will discuss proceeding.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillator. - As above, it is unclear if his arrhythmia is atrial or ventricular in origin; however, evidence weighs against ventricular origin given the inappropriate response to defibrillation and also lack of symptoms. However, cannot completely rule out. We will continue with the dose of Toprol currently and we will discuss potential plans for future treatment, which we believe will be more apparent after device upgrade. We will be able to determine if the arrhythmia is atrial or ventricular after device upgrade and we will discuss recommendations at that time.

I confirmed the history of present illness, ROS, and past/family/social history. I also personally performed the comprehensive cardiac exam detailed above including examination of the jugular veins, auscultation of the lungs, palpation and auscultation of the heart. In addition, I examined the carotid arteries, the abdomen for masses and bruits, the femoral arteries, distal pulses, and extremities for peripheral edema, clubbing and cyanosis. I reviewed all diagnostic test reports, and determined the assessment and plan.

He notes to have been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2012 almost incidently.  He had mild fatigue but was still rather active.  He went for a routine physical and there was concern for a new murmur so he went for echocardiography.  Echo at the time showed an EF of 20-25% with left ventricular dilation.  MRI showed late gadolinium enhancement in mid myocardial distribution involving the basal and mid septum but cardiac CT was clean (coronary score of 0).  He was started on beta-blocker and ACE-I and recent echo with EF of 35%.  QTc 132.  He is still active but has mild fatigue.  He plays goalie and is able to run on the field but states that likely DOE with longer distances.  He is here for placement of CRT-d, which was uncomplicated via left axillary approach.

 Interval History:
 Mr. Sa is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy who will be admitted after CRT-D placement.

His cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 2012 in the context of exertional limitation, dyspnea and fatigue. TTE demonstrated an LVEF of 15% at the time. Cardiac MRI showed LGE enhancement in a non-ischemic pattern; coronary CTA showed no evidence of coronary disease. 

He has remained on an optimal medical therapy regimen for nearly 2 years. LVEF has improved but stabilized at 35%. He has had NYHA I/II symptoms. ECG has shown LBBB with QRS of 130-135 msec. 

This year he was transitioned from lisinopril to an ARB given reports of a dry cough; this improved modestly with the transition. Otherwise, he continues to intermittently play goalie for a local soccer team and does feel intermittently out of breath with mild activity. He denies pedal edema, orthopnea, or PND.

MITRAL VALVE 
There is evidence of focal thickening of the anterior mitral leaflet. There is no evidence of mitral valve prolapse. There is incomplete closure of the mitral valve leaflets c/w papillary muscle displacement. There is mild mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler. 

LEFT ATRIUM 
The left atrium is dilated. The antero-posterior left atrial dimension is 49 mm (normal range: up to 38 mm). The medial-lateral left atrial dimension is 46 mm (normal range: up to 49 mm). The superior-inferior left atrial dimension is 62 mm (normal range: up to 53 mm). 

AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT 
There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis. The aortic valve is tricuspid. There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral Doppler. The aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva is 33 mm (normal: less than 40mm). The ascending aorta diameter above the sinotubular junction is 32 mm (normal: less than or equal to 36mm). 

LEFT VENTRICLE 
The left ventricular cavity size is dilated. The left ventricular systolic function is impaired. There is segmental left ventricular dysfunction (see wall motion plot). This involves the inferior territory. This involves the septal territory. This involves the apical territory. There is focal wall thinning and increased reflectivity suggesting a left ventricular scar. The estimated ejection fraction is 32 %. LVEF was measured by the single dimension method.

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency. 

PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A. 
There is no evidence of pulmonary stenosis. There is evidence of trace pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral Doppler. The RV systolic pressure was estimated from the regurgitant tricuspid velocity (assuming an RA pressure of 10mmHg). The estimated RV systolic pressure is 27 mmHg. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE 
The right ventricle is not dilated. The right ventricular systolic function is within normal limits. 

PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES 
There is no evidence of pericardial effusion. 

 EKG:
 8/25/2014 NSR, rate 72 bpm. PR 164 ms, QT 446ms. QRS 136 ms. LBBB, inferior TWI. No changes from prior. 

 Assessment and plan:
 Mr. Sa is a very pleasant 49 year old with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, LBBB, QRS width of 136 ms, NYHA II symptoms, and LVEF 35% on optimal medical therapy. 

He will undergo CRT-D implantation on 11/11/2014.

 Other Data:
 3/16/10 Echocardiogram showed mild thickening of anterior mitral leaflet. No MVP with incomplete closure of the MV leaflets c/w papillary muscle displacement, moderate MR with eccentric jet of MR that is directed posteriorly. LAE, 41 mm x 56 x 63. No AS, trivial AI. no aortic dilatation. LV dilated with LVIDd 72, LVIDs 66, diffuse hypokinesis, EF 16%. Mild TI. IVC dilated 27mm. Insufficient TR to estimate RVSP. RV size and function within normal limits. +interatrial septum closure device well seated and no shunting. No pericardial effusion. Compared to 9/2007 no important change. 

 Assessment and plan:
 Mr. Guido is a 51 year old gentleman with long-standing history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with NSVT s/p ICD in 2001 and VT ablation in 2005. He have been relatively stable with a small burden of NSVT events or VT detections treated with ATP over the past 5 years. His last VT detection was 2/23/10 as described above. He is medically managed with Sotalol, Mexiletine and Coumadin. He is also stable with his HF symptoms, NYHA FC 2. He is medically managed with ACE, BB (Sotalol) and Aldactone. 

We did not make any medication changes at his clinic visit in 11/2011 in regard to his NSVT or VT management. We have previously discussed that if his has more VT detections requiring therapy we would have a low threshold to increase his Mexiletine dose to 150mg TID, from BID. 

Most of his clinic visit focused on his progressive decline in function over 6 months or so with reported SOB with moderate exertion. He has a baseline LBBB with QRS of ~ 150 ms. At this time he meets new research indicated for CRT benefit with cardiomyopathy NYHA FC 2 patients (MADIT - CRT) and feel he would benefit from upgrading to CRT/biventricular device. 

We reviewed the risks of and recovery from upgrade from single chamber ICD to CRT-D which will include generator change, new A and LV leads. He and his wife had their questions answered and agree to proceed. He will not hold any medications prior to, with INR goal in the 2.0 - 2.5 range given his remote history of TIA/CVA prior to PFO closure 2005. After his upgrade, he will be referred to CRT Clinic for optimization. We will follow up with him once he returns to ICD Clinic.

Reason for Visit: ADMISSION NOTE.

 Mr. Deramo is a 64-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy with severely depressed LV function status-post dual chamber ICD, chronic obstructive lung disease, lung cancer, congestive heart failure, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, thyroid abnormalities and high burden of PVCs status-post ablation. 

The patient was last seen last month in June 2014. At the time, we attempted to reduce the amount of RV pacing but exacerbated his symptoms. The changes were reversed but the patient continues to feel quite symptomatic with dyspnea and appears to have declined over the past several weeks to clearly NYHA class II-III. Otherwise, he denies chest pain/pressure, palpitations, lightheadedness/syncope/ 

The patient was referred to us again for consideration of CRT given declining functional status. He appears to be predominantly RV-paced, thus he is a candidate for CRT upgrade. The procedure was presented to the patient and his wife who would like to proceed.

PULMONARY FOLLOWUP NOTE  


INTERIM HISTORY:  
Last here 4/14/14. Carol was present at the end of the visit. 
Ongoing back and hip pains prevent him from doing any exercise. Seeing many specialists for this. 
Pacemaker adjusted, plans to have a new one with third lead placed next month. 
Breathing OK on level ground, within the limitations of his back and hip pains. SOB going up incline or stairs. Only cough is sometimes when he first lies down.  


PROBLEM LIST:  
Referred to pulmonary 8/09 for evaluation of dyspnea, attributed to COPD, deconditioning, weight gain, in setting of underlying improved nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Workup revealed two PET-pos lesions: LLL mass (shown to be adenocarcinoma on percutaneous biopsy --> LLL lobectomy 1/122010) and RUL nodular opacity (bronch neg).  
SOB x 6-8 months, improving after ablation of VEA and starting Spiriva.  
Admitted to Jordan Hospital in 10/11 for "excessive fluid around the heart" --> diuresed, prednisone and antibiotics.Saw Dr. Carlson afterwards --> increased from 40 once daily to 40 am and 20 pm.New Singulair at bed time, maybe helps a little. 
smoking 1 ppd since teens 
COPD 
1990-91 severe stress, spitting up blood, CXR showed a lesion --> Dr. Einstein of pulmonary at South Shore Hospital --> antibiotics for pneumonia --> cleared up over about 8 months. No further hemoptysis.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

Dear Dr. Carlson,

 Dr. Singh and I saw Mr. Deramo again for follow-up and consideration for CRT therapy. As you know, he is a 64-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy with severely depressed LV function status-post dual chamber ICD, chronic obstructive lung disease, lung cancer, congestive heart failure, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, thyroid abnormalities and high burden of PVCs status-post ablation. 

The patient was last seen last month in June 2014. At the time, we attempted to reduce the amount of RV pacing but exacerbated his symptoms. The changes were reversed but the patient continues to feel quite symptomatic with dyspnea and appears to have declined over the past several weeks to clearly NYHA class II-III. Otherwise, he denies chest pain/pressure, palpitations, lightheadedness/syncope/ 

The patient was referred to us again for consideration of CRT given declining functional status. He appears to be predominantly RV-paced, thus he is a candidate for CRT upgrade. The procedure was presented to the patient and his wife who would like to proceed.

 Past medical history:
 Dilated Cardiomyopathy; LVEF 27%

Dear Dr. Carlson,  

       Thank you for the referral of Mr. Thomas Deramo.  As you know, he is a 64 year old male with recent low back and lateral hip pain.  I suspect he has spinal stenosis, and am sending him for a non-contrast CT of his lumbar spine to evaluate this further.  Please find my full note below, and thank you again for the referral. 


Kind regards,

Patient: Thomas Deramo 

MGH MRN: 3608496 

DOV: 6/18/14 

Referred by: Dr. Carlson 


CC/Indication for referral:  Evaluation of back and hip pain 

HPI: 64 yo male with, per records, recent low back and hip pain, present both at rest and with walking, also with sensation of locking. 

Per patient, he notes he started having hip problems 18 to 24 months ago, getting progressively worse.  Due to various cardiac and pulm issues, he deferred addressing this, but now, the pain has become debilitating.  He saw a vascular specialist, who will have him do some further testing, but the diagnosis of spinal stenosis is being considered.  He notes any walking leads to pain.  He saw an orthopedist (outside MGH) and was told "it doesn't look that bad" but also recommended he take steroids, which he didn't want to do.  His pain begains in his low back laterally, then his hips lock up and the pain goes up his back.  His feet are also numb.  At rest sitting or lying down, he has no pain.  If he stands, after some time, it starts to hurt.  Leaning on a shopping cart helps, but does not make the pain go away.  He doesn't think there is a difference in his pain walking up a hill or down a hill.

Dear Dr. McGowen 

 I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Thomas Deramo in my office today in cardiology.

As you know, he is a very pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who has a history of cardiomyopathy with severely depressed LV function. He was initially diagnosed in 1998 with an ejection fraction of 25% with some recovery and ejection fraction actually rose to 50% with LV function subsequently deteriorated again after surgery for lung cancer. He had significant ventricular ectopy and underwent ablation after his initial ejection fraction of 25% and the ablation probably related to his increase in cardiac function. He does have a significant ventricular burden now and he was hospitalized recently at MGH and had a biventricular pacemaker placed in order to allow us to use beta-blockers more judiciously. He returns now, says that he feels much better after placement of the pacemaker and titration of his beta-blockers. He has been managing his diuretics according to wt and leg cramps. 


 Past medical history:
 Dilated Cardiomyopathy; LVEF 27% 
Catheter ablation for PVC burden 7/09 (42% of beats) 
Hypertension. 
Hyperlipidemia. 
Dilated cardiomyopathy. 
Fell on to his left leg during the motorcycle accident in 2006 with subsequent infection. 
Adenocarcimona

 EKG:
 shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, like axis deviation consistent with left anterior hemiblock, right bundle-branch block and single PVC.

Assessment and Plan: 
This is a very pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive lung disease, lung cancer, fluid overload, congestive heart failure, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, thyroid abnormalities, high burden of PVCs, which has been ablated and was thought to be partially responsible for his decreased LV function. He has had pacemaker placed now to allow us to use beta-blockers in a higher doses to control his PVCs and also for treatment of his congestive heart failure. He is symptomatically much better. He seems to be doing reasonably well at this point without any evidence of pulmonary edema. His major problem appears to be early satiety and alternating constipation and diarrhea. He has been seen by GI and recently hada a colonoscopy. We will continue to monitor his wt and fluid status. My plan would be to see him back here in another six weeks. We will check a lipid profile just prior to that visit as well as electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, CBC and a BMP. If he begins to gain weight again or notices diminution in his exercise capacity, he will call here for further advice. I'd also like to have him see Dr. Singh for possible BiV pacer CRT. 

As always, it is a pleasure to be able to participate in the care of this very pleasant gentleman.

Best personal regards.

Dear Dr. Carlson 

Reason for Visit: Today I saw Mr Thomas Deramo in vascular followup with Dr Joseph Garasic.

 Dr Garasic initially saw Mr Deramo in consultation for leg discomfort. 
He was seen by a vascular specialist at another facility, last year at which point LENI's were obtained. This showed ABI's of 1.0 on the right and 0.93 on the left. This study was performed at rest. He was noted to have multiphasic signals throughout.

He did demonstrate a femoral bruit on exam, and given his risk factors of hyperlipidemia and prior heavy tobacco use, it was decided he would have ABI with exercise study to evaluate for PAD contributing to his symptoms. It was also felt he had significant neurogenic qualities to his symptoms. He was evaluated by Dr Mark Fisher who obtained non contrast CT of the spine ( as he also has some CRI).

He denies rest pain
He does have numbness of both #1 toes at night and the sensation of his sock is bunched up on both heels, worse at night. His feet feel better during the day, worse at night. His feet will feel better when he puts his slippers on, versus bare feet. If he stands up at night his feet will be numb, but the pain is better. He notes discomfort with even the covers touching his toes. 
He has significant bilateral hip pain and low back pain with standing. At times he feels his hips will "lock up " on him when he stands.
No tissue ulceration on either foot.
Rash on trunk comes and goes, told this was eczema. 
No CP
+SOB chronic. He noted significant SOB with recent ICD change. He is to have repeat ICD adjustment which is being arranged by D Sullivan NP. 

He feels his back/hip and leg discomfort is disabling, he cannot work. He is quite upset. 
He reports he cannot stand still in the shower as his back pain is so diabilitating

In 2006 he had a significant MVA while on a motorcycle and hit a deer. He required significant surgery including hardware placement and told his left leg is shorter than his right leg. He also reports he has had residual numbness of his left ankle since that accident.

 Past medical history:
 Dilated Cardiomyopathy; LVEF 27% now 19%
Catheter ablation for PVC burden 7/09 (42% of beats)

Hypertension. 
Hyperlipidemia.

 FINDINGS: 
 RIGHT: The ankle/brachial index (ABI) is 0.98. No prior 
 ankle/brachial index (ABI). Pulse volume recordings (PVR) and 
 segmental limb pressures suggest normal lower extremity arterial 
 circulation at rest. 

 LEFT: The ankle/brachial index (ABI) is 0.80. No prior 
 ankle/brachial index (ABI). Pulse volume recordings (PVR) and 
 segmental limb pressures suggest popliteal/tibial artery disease at 
 rest. 

 EXERCISE TESTING: The patient was placed on a graded treadmill at 
 1.5 MPH with a 12% grade. The patient exercised for 1.75 minutes on 
 the treadmill, noting symptoms of bilateral hip pain. There was a 
 significant reduction in arterial circulation after exercise, 
 consistent with intermittent claudication physiology.

 IMPRESSIONS: 
 1. No evidence of significant peripheral arterial disease at rest in 
 the right leg.
 2. Moderate peripheral arterial disease in the left leg.
 3. Disease is located in the popliteal/tibial artery segments on the 
 left side.
 4. Significant drop in the ankle/brachial index (ABI) from 0.98 to 
 0.91 on the right and from 0.80 to 0.68 on the left, consistent with 
 bilateral intermittent claudication physiology.
 5. The ankle/brachial index is 0.98 on the right and 0.80 on the left.
 6. The toe/brachial index is 0.70 on the right and 0.48 on the left.

Assessment and Plan: 

Peripheral arterial disease .. - We reviewed his ABI with exercise study today which demonstrates mild PAD of left LE. We discussed at length his symptoms are more suggestive of a neurogenic etiology. We would follow his PAD with repeat vascular study in one year. He has been referred to pain clinic which he is deciding if he will pursue. He has seen orthopedist and will discuss spine specialist with PCP.

Leg pain - Disc disease and pars defect on CT LS spine study
 - Disc disease and pars defect on CT LS spine study

I have seen and examined Mr Deramo in concert with Deb Hines, NP and I agree with her assessment and plan. As detailed, he returns in f/u SDP/PVRs suggestive of left > right LE PAD. PVR's are pulsatile to the digital level and together with the exam, speak against CLI. My sense is that while he has LE PAD, his sx's are atypical of claudication and his pain is most likely neuropathic. Post exercise ABI is 0.68. I would recommend pursuing a spinal / neuropathic etiology to his back pain, and have him see us again in one year with repeat vascular studies. If rx of spinal stenosis / neuropathic pain is not fruitful, we certainly can reconsider.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

Note: There is an addendum for this note (3/3/2009) 

 Reason for visit:
 Referred by Dr. Semigran for evaluation for CRT-D.

 Interval History:
 52 year old lady with a history of dilated CMP, NYHA Class II-IIIa CHF referred for possible cardiac resynchronization therapy. Ms. Larsen was initially diagnosed with a cardiomyopathy 5 years ago. At that time, her PCP noted a murmur on exam and referred her to Dr. Horowitz (her cardiologist). He did a stress-MIBI and noted 'sluggish' heart function. She was treated appropriately with coreg in addition to the quinapril she was already taking.

She did reasonably well in Class I-II CHF till Dec 2007 when she noted marked DOE, othopnea and PND. She was diagnosed with CHF and treated with diuretics. She again improved till the fall of 2008 when she again noted worsening orthopnea, PND, edema and palpitations. At this time she had another echocardiogram that showed an LVEF of 25%, , LVIDd of 4.7 as well as severe MR due to likely poor coaptation of the leaflets. Since then she has been on lasix, and still notes occasional PND, moderate DOE and occasional edema, although she is better. She is seeking a second opinion and therefore saw Dr. Semigran, and is now referred for possible CRT-D.

She denies any syncope, AF, TIA or CVA. Mild nephropathy from DM. 

 Past medical history:
 1. DCM as above
2. Type II DM
3. Mild nephropathy
4. GERD

-Chest: Clear to auscultation and percussion.
-Cardiac: PMI nondisplaced. Regular S1, S2, II/VI systolic murmur.
-Abdomen: Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.

-BP: 104/70 right arm

 EKG:
 NSR. LAE. LBBB with QRS 130 msec.

 Impression:
 52 year old lady with a history of dilated CMP that has been progressive over the past 5 years despite appropriate medical therapy. Whether the mitral regurgitation was the culprit or is secondary to the dilatation of the annulus is unclear, although the fact that her LA is not particularly dilated suggests the second option is more likely (although curiously her LV is not particularly dilated). She is currently in class II to class IIIa heart failure and has evidence of electrical dysynchrony. She would clearly benefit from an ICD in terms of SCD prevention (per SCD-HEFT). In addition, I think she would benefit from CRT therapy. I spend > 30 minutes explaining the risks and benefits of CRT therapy. The patient wants to proceed with this, but wants to discuss with her husband further. We will contact her for timing for this device. I also discussed the trials that we are conducting and gave her literature as well as consent forms to look over in case she was interested in participating in any of them.

 Interval History:
 Patient call to the office of Dr M. Semigran with condition update.

Ms Larsen called today as she was instructed to do with update on weights and condition. She reports having decreased Lasix to 20 mg QD as she was directed on 2/5 -see previous note. She noted abdominal and finger swelling on this dose and was up 2 lbs this morning. Ms Larsen had instructions to increase the lasix back up to 40 mg if weight increases by 2 or more lbs and she did this as of this morning. She will continue on the 40 mg dose and contact us for weight gain of 2 or more lbs over 2 days. 

Ms Larsen is happy to report that she started feeling better over the weekend with "more energy" after the carvedilol dose increase on 1/27.

Informed patient that I would relay above information to Joan Doody NP.

 Interval History:
 Telephone call from patient to the office of Dr Marc Semigran with report of chest pain. 

Return call to Ms Larsen who was in for office visit with Joan Doody NP on 1/27/09. She states that at that visit, Carvedilol was increased from 6.25mg BID to 12.5mg BID and Lasix increased to 60 mg daily from 40 mg QD. Reports baseline weight to be 100 lbs. 
Since adjustments in meds, she has noted increased fatigue and without energy. Also reports episodes of dizziness while walking. She denies SOB and states that she decreased her lasix back to 40 mg daily since she had lost 2 lbs in 2 days with the increased dosage. She has just started to check her BP and heartrate; 99/62, 77. Weight today is 99 lbs. 
She has also noted left sided chest discomfort that occurred yesterday but it was associated with moving her body a certain way. 

Informed patient that I would relay above information to Joan Doody and defer to her for plan. 

Return call to patient and again reassured her that it may take awhile before starting to feel better post med adjustments and that chest discomfort does not sound like it would be cardiac in origin as it occured with shifting her body a certain way. 
Per Joan Doody, lasix cut back to 20 mg daily; pt instructed to increase back up to 40 mg if weight increases by 2 or more lbs. Instructed to continue checking BP and heartrate at least daily and to call us with condition update on Monday, 2/9. Patient understands and agrees with plan. Encouraged patient to call us with questions and concerns.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 Consultation re: cardiomyopathy, possible TXP evaluation

 Interval History:
 Ms. Larsen is a 52 year old WF presenting for consideration for advanced HF therapies, including potential cardiac transplantation. Her primary cardiologist is Dr. Stephen Horowitz. 

She has a history of dilated CMP diagnosed in 2003. She recalls the initial evaluation was prompted by a murmur on exam. She underwent a stress-MIBI at that time revealing decreased heart function. She has been followed by Dr Horowitz since. and was begun on medical therapy including Coreg and ACEI. In late 2007-2008 she developed Class II symptoms with CHF and cough.. She underwent a cath in Oct 2008 revealing nonobstructive CAD and an EF of 20% with global HK, and 3+ MR. RA was 6, PA 35/15, PCW 18 and CI 2.06. An echo Oct 2008 revealed LVID of 4.7, and EF 25% with severe MR. She was begun on diuretics with temporary improvement. 

She feels her symptoms are progressing over the past year with her major current complaint being fatigue and effort intolerance. She complains of profound fatigue and weakness after usual daily activities, i.e. housework, or if she must stand for any length of time. She also develops dyspnea with 1 flight of stairs on a good day, but only after several stairs on a bad day. She reports 2 pillow orthopnea, and prior PND episodes, none since diuretics were begun. She notices ankle edema towards the end of the day. Her appetite is reduced and she feels more bloated this past week. 

She denies any syncope, but has complaints of intermittent orthostatic lightheadedness and intermittent palpitations which may also cause lightheadedness.

 Review of systems:
 As detailed above. She also reports leg cramps and insomnia she attributes to her fibromyalgia, improved with nortriptyline. 

Physical examination: 
-Pulse: 98 
-weight: 100 lbs.
-General appearance: White female in NAD; fatigued appearing
-Skin: No rashes, anicteric
-HEENT: MMM. No scleral icterus.

-Extremities: No edema. Warm and well perfused. 
-Neuro: AO x3, CN 2-12 grossly intact. 
-BP: 116/70 right arm

 EKG:
 NSR. Rate 98, with LAE. LBBB with QRS 130 msec.

 Other Data:
 Records from OSH including cath and echo reports reviewed. se paper chart.

 Assessment and plan:
 Ms. Larsen is a 52 yo WF with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, confirmed on cath. She appears very well compensated with no evidence of volume overload. Her exam is somewhat out of proportion to her symptoms, which are definitely NYHA FC III and somewhat concerning for low output HF. She is ACC/AHA stage C. 

We would recommend the following: 
1. Referral to EP for consideration of a prophylactic ICD and consideration of possible CRT-D based on her functional class, severe MR; QRS is borderline. 
2. We asked her to increase her Coreg to 12.5mg BID in an effort to maximize her neurohormonal regimen. 
3. We asked her to increase her Lasix to 60mg qd as the Coreg may cause some issues with worsened fluid retention and to see if this improves her symptoms. 
4. She was asked to begin monitoring daily AM weights and home VS to assess response to these changes and to contact our office in 1-2 weeks with an update, sooner for any worsened symptoms or concerns. 
5. Long term, we will also arrange for an echocardiogram post adjustments to her HF regimen and potential device placement. If she remains Class III and EF is not improving, we may proceed with CPET Level I to objectively measure her functional capacity and assist us in risk stratifying for cardiac transplant. 
6. We will consider addition of an aldosterone antagonist at future visit.
7. We will see her back in 3 months, sooner prn.

Greater than 50% of this 80 mins visit was spent in coordination of care and counseling/education re: the above clinical issues.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 Referred by Dr. Goroll for PPM generator ERI.

 Interval History:
 60 year old African American lady with h/o
- Guidant VVIR PPM in 1992 (Guidant 1226), atrial lead 330-854 for SSS.
- h/o syncope in 2004, positive tilt test in the past.
- h/o DCM with LV noted to be diffusely hypokinetic and depressed in function on a DSE in 2004 (DSE negative for inducible ischemia).
- Class II CHF with symptoms of fatigue and DOE.
- HTN
- DM

She was noted to have PPM generator ERI on transtelephonic monitoring and is now presenting to schedule a generator change. She is not pacemaker dependent and her leads could not be fully interrogated at the time of the visit.

She has not had any recent assessment of LVEF. Denies any f/c/ns/PND/orthopnea/edema/palpitations/CVA/TIA.

 Past medical history:
 1. SSS s/p PPM (unclear if she has any PAF).
2. DCM with class II CHF and negative DSE for ischemia in 2004.
3. Positive tilt test
4. HTN
5. DM
6. Gout
7. Spinal stenosis.
8. Remote DVT, on coumadin.

Aunt had ?SCD at 29: unclear circumstances.

 Social history:
 No tob since 1988. No EtOH.

 Review of systems:
 As above. Otherwise negative in detail.

Physical examination: 
-Pulse: 69 
-Neck: Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention
-Chest: Clear to auscultation and percussion.
-Cardiac: Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 or S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.
-Abdomen: Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated. Obese.
-Extremities: Trace edema.
-BP: 130/85 
-General appearance: No acute distress.
-Skin: No rashes, anicteric.

 EKG:
 SR. PR 232 msec. QRS 88 msec. QTc 420 msec.

 Impression:
 60 year old with h/o SSS, PPM in 1992 now with generator ERI. Will plan for ECHO to assess LV function especially since she complains of fatigue and DOE. If LVEF > 35% will just plan for PPM generator change. If she has low EF (less than 35%) would consider upgrade to ICD (she would be in the SCD-HEFT population that shows improved mortality from ICD therapy).
ECHO has been scheduled for 4/30 and device replacement the following week.

 Interval History:
 Cardiology Admission Note (for Dr Januzzi) 

Micheal Auciello, a 77-year-old gentleman, with ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted for CRT device implant. 

He has a history of chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He apparently was recognized as having low ejection fraction with evidence for a prior old inferior wall myocardial infarction. In November of this year, he was admitted to the Newton-Wellesley Hospital with complaints of feeling "sluggish." He was found to be in congestive heart failure and was diuresed. His medications were adjusted. His medication program at the time of admission in November included a calcium channel blocker, which was discontinued, fenofibrate, which was discontinued, and a low dose of lisinopril. He had adjustments in his medication program and now include carvedilol at high dose as well as a diuretic. In addition, his lipid lowering was changed to simvastatin. Lastly, lisinopril was increased. He had a thallium stress test demonstrating him to have no evidence for a provokable ischemia. 

Echocardiography done both at Newton-Wellesley Hospital as well as at the Massachusetts General Hospital subsequently demonstrates his ejection fraction to be no higher than 20%. The echo done here at the MGH, his left ventricular internal dimension was 62 mm end-diastole, which is quite dilated. He had moderate mitral regurgitation, an ejection fraction of 20%, and right ventricular systolic pressure of 45 mmHg. He has moderate MR and mild TR. 

After discharge He underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test which demonstrates excellent oxygen consumption with an MVO2 max of 17.7, which is 80% predicted, but rather good given his considerable LV dysfunction. Subsequent to being diuresed and having his medication program changed, Mr. Auciello denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dizziness, or syncope. He does note modest dyspnea on exertion, perhaps putting him at New York Heart Association class II-III. He denies any sustained palpitations. 

Since his discharge, Mr. Auciello has been watching his sodium and fluid intake. His weight is about 171 and fairly consistent but he does not take it regularly. He is admitted now for BiV ICD. 

 Past medical history:

CKD (creat ~2.0-2.5) 
Hypertension 
hyperlipidemia 
ischemic cardiomyopathy as detailed above (EF 20% mod MR, mild TR) 

Medications on Admission

Lasix 40mg daily 
Lisinopril 20mg daily 
Simvastatin 20mg daily

 Family history:
 Notable for premature CAD in his father.

 Social history:
 He is married. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He continues to work part-time, quite happily.

 Review of systems:
 Negative in detail as outlined in his medical record.

Physical examination: 
-Pulse: 66 
-General: No acute distress
-Skin: No rashes. Anicteric
-Heent: Unremarkable
-Neck: JVP of 8. Carotids are brisk bilaterally
-Chest: Clear to anterior exam
-Cardiac: Apical impulse diffuse and displaced. He is an irregularly irregular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and a paradoxically split S2. There is a grade 1-2 systolic murmur of MR. There is soft S3 gallop as well

Rifat B Dweik M.D. 
Newton-Wellesley Hospital
20 Hope Avenue, Suite G07
Waltham, MA 02453

 Interval History:
 Asked by Dr. Rifat Dweik of Newton-Wellesley Hospital to evaluate Micheal Auciello, a 77-year-old gentleman, with ischemic cardiomyopathy for advanced heart failure management. Mr. Auciello's past medical history is well summarized in medical record, but I will briefly review. Mr. Auciello is a 77-year-old gentleman with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He apparently was recognized as having low ejection fraction with evidence for a prior old inferior wall myocardial infarction. In November of this year, he was admitted to the Newton-Wellesley Hospital with complaints of feeling "sluggish." He was found to be in congestive heart failure and was diuresed. His medications were adjusted. His medication program at the time of admission in November included a calcium channel blocker, which was discontinued, fenofibrate, which was discontinued, and a low dose of lisinopril. He had adjustments in his medication program and now include carvedilol at high dose as well as a diuretic. In addition, his lipid lowering was changed to simvastatin. Lastly, lisinopril was increased. He had a thallium stress test demonstrating him to have no evidence for a provokable ischemia. Echocardiography done both at Newton-Wellesley Hospital as well as at the Massachusetts General Hospital subsequently demonstrates his ejection fraction to be no higher than 20%. The echo done here at the MGH, his left ventricular internal dimension was 62 mm end-diastole, which is quite dilated. He had moderate mitral regurgitation, an ejection fraction of 20%, and right ventricular systolic pressure of 45 mmHg. Subsequent to discharge, I requested a cardiopulmonary exercise test on Mr. Auciello, which demonstrates excellent oxygen consumption with an MVO2 max of 17.7, which is 80% predicted, but rather good given his considerable LV dysfunction. Subsequent to being diuresed and having his medication program changed, Mr. Auciello denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dizziness, or syncope. He does note modest dyspnea on exertion, perhaps putting him at New York Heart Association class II-III. He denies any sustained palpitations.

Since his discharge, Mr. Auciello has been watching his sodium intake. He does not weigh himself, however, and his fluid intake has not been well scrutinized either. I am not seeing him today in the office for advanced heart failure management and recommendations.

 Past medical history:
 As noted. In addition, he has a history of prostate cancer.

 Changes to Allergies 
No known drug allergy: although atorvastatin is currently listed as an allergy with an unknown reaction.

 Family history:
 Notable for premature CAD in his father.

 Social history:
 He is married. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He continues to work part-time, quite happily.

 Review of systems:
 Negative in detail as outlined in his medical record.

Physical examination: 
-Pulse: 68
-BP: 120/70 
-weight: 173 lbs.
-General: No acute distress
-Skin: No rashes. Anicteric
-Heent: Unremarkable
-Neck: JVP of 8-9. There is modest hepatojugular reflux. Carotids are brisk bilaterally
-Chest: Clear
-Cardiac: Apical impulse diffuse and displaced. He is an irregularly irregular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and a paradoxically split S2. There is a grade 1-2 systolic murmur of MR. There is an S3 gallop as well
-Abdomen: Soft. Nontender. The liver is not pulsatile
-Extremities: No edema. They are warm and well perfused

Procedures: 
Electrocardiogram Normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, frequent PVCs. He has an old IMI and IVCD consistent with a left bundle-branch block configuration and nonspecific ST-T wave changes. I have no prior tracing with which to compare.

 Impression:
 1. Chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. Mr. Auciello was well managed on a high dose of beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, and diuretic. I am going to check a NT-proBNP, and aim for a target value less than 1000 picograms/mL. Given his chronic kidney disease, we will also check a serum creatinine. If amenable, I would like to try to get him on to spironolactone in addition to the current medication program. Given his wide QRS complex and impending implantation of a defibrillator (see below), I think it is reasonable to contemplate cardiac resynchronization therapy for him as well. I discussed salt restriction with him in detail. Furthermore, we reviewed the importance of daily weights. I recommended that he check his weight every morning at the same time after emptying his bladder and recording the results. Lastly, I have reviewed fluid restriction in more detail. We voiced a clear understanding of the recommendations, which includes a limit of 2 liters/day. I encouraged him to continue exercising, in light of his surprisingly good oxygen consumption.
2. He has indications for primary ICD implantation. Accordingly, we will proceed with implantation of a defibrillator. The discussion as above is whether to do resynchronization therapy at the same time. Given his impaired creatinine, it is going to be somewhat challenging to get him on to spironolactone or a higher dose of ACE inhibitor. Therefore, CRT seems quite reasonable.
3. Goal LDL is less than 70 mg/dL, given the high risk nature of potential progression of CAD in this gentleman.
4. He has frequent ventricular ectopy currently. I would continue the carvedilol at the dose that he is currently taking. Hopefully, we can get a defibrillator in him prior to any substantial ventricular arrhythmic event.

 Medication List 
 CONFIRMED
 - aspirin 81 mg QD
 - carvedilol 25 mg BID
 - folic acid 1 mg QD
 - furosemide 40 mg QD
 - lisinopril 20 mg QD
 - medication list reviewed 
 - simvastatin 20 mg QHS

HPI (history per OSH records, patient's parents): Ms. Wasielewski is a 37F w/ a history of EtOH abuse s/p VF arrest and unstable PMVT c/b complete heart block and hypotension, who was transferred from an OSH to the CCU on dopamine and w/ pacing wire for further work-up and management.  About 1 month ago, she was started on bupropion for smoking cessation, and had a ~20lb weight gain over the next 2 weeks, leading her to discontinue the drug.  During this time she had malaise and felt generally unwell.  Thinking it may have been an allergic response, she took benadryl with minimal relief.  In the 5 days leading to her VF arrest on 11/3, she experienced a cough with whitish sputum that was worse while supine, and continued to retain weight. She also had subjective fevers and had discussed going in to the doctor on 11/3, but instead went to work at The Christmas Tree Store, where she arrested at 5pm.  She received ~4 minutes of CPR before EMS arrived and cardioverted her out of VF.  She was taken to Cape Cod hospital where she was noted to be in CHB, hypotensive, and minimally response with some 'seizure-like' activity.  She was intubated, started on dopamine, and taken to the cath lab.  There she had a temp wire placed and was found to have clean coronary arteries but an EF of 25% with dilated LV, global hypokinesis, and 2 LV aneurysms.  Her troponin was slightly positive at 0.212, BNP was 1240, and her urine tox and EtOH screens were negative.  She was transferred to BWH for further work-up and management.   


Of note, Ms. Wasielewski's last drink was in July, at which time she was hospitalized with EtOH poisoning (level 379).  During the same month, she was worked up for syncope/seizure and was noted on EKG to have RBBB and LAFB.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Wasielewski is a 36-year-old woman with a longstanding history of prior ethanol abuse, depression, ADHD, and a possible seizure or syncopal episode in July 2014 during an episode of alcohol intoxication.  She states that her last drink was in July and thereafter did well until approximately 1 month ago when she was started on Wellbutrin to treat increasing anxiety, depression and to assist in smoking cessation.  Following initiation of the Wellbutrin, she states that she gradually developed increasing fatigue, weight gain, exertional dyspnea and generally felt unwell.  Approximately 1-2 weeks ago, she developed a possible URI with low-grade fevers and a mildly productive cough.  On 11/03/14, while at work, she had a sudden syncopal episode.  CPR was started quickly and when EMS arrived, they found her in ventricular fibrillation.  She received a 200 joule shock with return of spontaneous circulation.  She was started on amiodarone and brought to Cape Cod Hospital where she was intubated and continued on dopamine and propofol.  Her initial potassium was 3.6.  She was admitted to the ICU, but while there developed increasing bradycardia and in fact had what appears to be a PEA arrest complicated by polymorphic VT.  A temporary pacing wire was placed and she was brought to the catheterization laboratory where coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary artery disease, a globally depressed left ventricle with an estimated ejection fraction of 25% and what appeared to be outpouchings on both the anterior and inferoposterior wall of the left ventricle.  At this point, she was transferred to the Brigham and Women's Hospital for further care. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As mentioned above is notable for alcohol abuse, ADHD.  In the past, she has taken Ritalin. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Reveals an intubated woman in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm supine 95/60, heart rate 80, and breathing on assist control at a tidal 450, respiratory rate of 16, FiO2 of 40% with a peripheral oxygen saturation of 100%.  The neck is supple.  JVP is approximately 9-10 cm.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Chest is clear anteriorly.  Cardiac exam reveals distant heart sounds with a grade 1-2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border.  The abdomen is overweight, but otherwise benign without evidence of organomegaly, ascites, aneurysm, or bruit.  Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact. 


Electrocardiogram shows a third-degree AV block with a paced ventricular rate of approximately 80 and underlying sinus rate of approximately 60. 


LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent lab values  include a random glucose of 92, creatinine of 0.7, potassium of 3.8, bicarbonate 26, calcium 7.9, magnesium 2.1, minimally abnormal liver function studies with an ALT of 86, AST 60, alkaline phosphatase 56, total bilirubin of 0.4, CPK of 508, CPK-MB 11.8, troponin T 0.01, NtBNP 4146.  Ferritin 28, TSH 0.4, hematocrit 38, white count 15.4, platelet count 165,000.  Chest x-ray shows a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette with minimal pulmonary congestion. 


IMPRESSION:  Ms.  Wasielewski is a 36-year-old woman with a longstanding history of ethanol abuse (although according to her mother has not consumed alcohol since July) and recent addition of Wellbutrin to treat a longstanding depression and anxiety disorder. 


Electrocardiogram performed in July showed evidence at that time of an incomplete right bundle-branch block and currently she is status post VT/VF arrest with a subsequent cardiac catheterization confirming normal coronary arteries and global and regional left ventricular dysfunction with at least 2 apparent outpouchings in the left ventricle.  The specific etiology of her cardiac dysfunction is to be determined.  Although she does have a history of the past several days of a viral infection, I am still quite suspicious of a prior underlying cardiomyopathy, possibly secondary to ethanol abuse.  Her mother states that she has not had any recent tick bites, exposure to other infected people, or family history for cardiomyopathy, sudden death or arrhythmias. 


Currently, she is pacemaker dependent, precluding our ability to perform an MRI.  Our initial management will be to obtain a 2D echocardiogram, send off appropriate viral and infectious titers to look.  Specifically, we will look for any underlying rickettsial disease, Lyme carditis, etc.  We will contact members of Electrophysiology Service.  Our initial hemodynamic management will include attempts to wean her intravenous pressure support (currently low-dose dopamine) and her clinical course will determine subsequent therapeutic and diagnostic studies.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Wasielewski is a 36-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, depression, ADHD, and previous syncopal versus seizure episode in July 2014 in the setting of alcohol intoxication who now presents to BWH as transfer following a witnessed VF arrest on 11/03/14. 


Per outside hospital records, Ms. Wasielewski has been sober for about a year before repeat alcohol abuse earlier this summer in July 2014.  She then had a syncopal episode versus seizure while she was acutely intoxicated. Following EKG from that admission revealed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and right bundle-branch block.  We have no other details of echo or further cardiac investigations done at that time.  She remained abstinent following that episode and then about a month ago due to worsening depressive symptoms, was started on Wellbutrin.  In the following 2 weeks after starting Wellbutrin, she noted a 20-pound weight gain and ultimately stopped this medication 2 weeks ago.  Due to concern for rapid onset "puffiness," they were concerned for an allergice reaction and she took Benadryl per her pharmacist.  Over the past week, though, she has had a persistent non-productive cough, worse when lying down, and +/- subjective fevers.  She ultimately returned to work on 11/03/14 with slight improvement in her symptoms where she had a witnessed syncopal episode and was unresponsive.  EMS arrived and she was found to be in ventricular fibrillation and received a 200 joules shock with return of spontaneous circulation with a ventricular rate of 40 and blood pressure of 60/40.  She received amiodarone 150 en route to Cape Cod Hospital.  Due to possible seizure activity and altered mental status in the ER at that time she was intubated and started on dopamine and propofol.  Initial potassium on arrival was 3.6.  No record of magnesium level.  Noted to be in CHB and bradycardic, improved rates on dopamine. She then suffered a bradycardiac PEA arrest and subsequent polymorphic VT during ACLS and was transferred to the Cath Lab.  Catheterization did not reveal any obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease, though LV gram was concerning for discrete aneurysmal outpouching and globally depressed EF of 25%.  Temp wire was placed and she was transferred to BWH for further evaluation. 


On arrival to the LCU, she was afebrile at 98.6, heart rate V paced at 80, blood pressure 95/57, breathing at 16, satting 97% on 40% FiO2.  Vent settings are tidal volume 450, rate of 16, FiO2 of 0.4 and PEEP of 5.  She was on dopamine 4, midazolam 6 and propofol 3.2.  Her temporary pacer was turned down and she was notably in sinus rhythm with third-degree AV block with no ventricular escape. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for alcohol abuse, ADHD and a syncopal versus seizure episode in the setting of acute EtOH intoxication in July 2014. 


Please refer to house officer admission note for detailed family and social history.  Notably, there is no history of sudden cardiac death.  There is a paternal uncle with an "enlarged heart". 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile 98.6, heart rate 80, blood pressure 95/57, respiratory rate 16, 97% on the vent.  In general, she is a young Caucasian female who is intubated and sedated.  HEENT reveals small pupils that are reactive.  Neck exam reveals intermittent cannon A waves and JVP that is elevated to 12+ cm of water.  She has regular rate with a soft S1 and S2 with an intermittent S3.  There is no RV heave and PMI cannot be appreciated while supine.  Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout with mechanical breath sounds in the vent.  Abdomen is soft, nondistended with normal bowel sounds.  Her extremities are warm with 1+ DP pulses bilaterally and 2+ radial pulses.  Neurologic exam:  She is sedated and attempts to open eyes to voice though cannot follow commands.  She withdraws all extremities to painful stimuli.  She has a right femoral triple lumen catheter.  Her left groin site is clean, dry, and intact with no obvious hematoma or bruit.  She has a right subclavian temporary line in place. 


Initial labs from the outside hospital revealed a white blood cell count of 10 with 71% neutrophils, eos 16 and 90% neutrophils.  Her D-dimer is 2.26.  INR is 1.4.  All hepatitis antibodies were nonreactive at the outside hospital.  Initial troponin (presumably I) was less than assay and then 0.17.  Initial BNP was 757, which rose to 1240.  Her GFR was greater than 60 and AST and ALT were elevated in the 60 range.  Her tox screen at the outside hospital was negative. 


On arrival to BWH, her potassium was 3.8, bicarbonate 26, creatinine 0.7, ionized calcium 1.09, T bili 0.4, AST, ALT 16 and 86, alkaline phosphatase 56.  Her urine pregnancy test is negative.  CK 508, troponin T of 0.01.  TSH 0.4.  INR is 1.4.  White blood cell count of 15,000 with 80% neutrophil predominance, platelets of 165, hematocrit 38.9 with an MCV of 94.9.  ESR is 2.   


ECG revealed underlying sinus rhythm with third degree AV block with ventricularly paced rhythm at 80. 


IMAGING:  CT PE protocol was negative for acute PE at the outside hospital.  CT abdomen and pelvis did not reveal any remarkable findings. 


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Wasielewski is a 36-year-old woman coming in with a witnessed VF arrest and evidence of cardiomyopathy on ventriculogram concern for focal aneurysm with dilatation.  Her story is interesting in that she had a syncopal episode earlier this summer with an ECG at that time abnormal, revealing a right bundle-branch block and left anterior fascicular block and no other prior known cardiac history.  Her symptoms over the past month are concerning for increasing weight gain, though we are unable to gather full history from the patient to determine whether there is evidence of further heart failure during this time or whether this weight gain could have all been education related to Wellbutrin.  There is concern for new cardiomyopathy on left heart catheterization and at this time, the differential remains broad including acute myocarditis, or a resolved myocarditis picture from July earlier this year now resulting in subsequent ventricular arrhythmias from scar.  The concern for polymorphic VT; however, increases with suspicion of something more acute, while dilatation concerning for more of a subacute process.  We will plan to send a broad workup at this point including viral studies, infiltrative disease and inflammatory causes.  There  is no concern for acute elevation of inflammatory markers on arrival as well as no obvious eosinophilic predominance on white blood cell count.  Tox screen is also negative, though she has had psychotropic medication exposure in the past and we will check levels here.  Per family, there is no acute concern for recent suicidal ideation or suicide attempt that would increase concern for possible drug overdose.  She is volume overloaded on exam, though given lack of peripheral edema or hepatomegaly, seems to be more of an acute process versus something that has been going on for some time.  Her transaminases are mildly elevated as is her INR though which could suggest a slightly longer hepatic congestion.  We will plan to check a TTE to better assess LV function now that we are several hours out from her recent arrest and to evaluate for aneurismal outpouching seen on the ventriculogram.  We will try to wean sedation and pressors and continue to monitor her mental status.  Her urine output since arrival to the CCU and has remained brisk, though we will plan to diurese for additional unloading of the myocardium given evidence of volume overload on exam and elevated LVEDP from cath. 


This case was discussed with the CCU attending, Dr. James Kirshenbaum.

Ms. Wasielewski is a 36-year-old woman without prior cardiac history who is transferred from Cape Cod Hospital following a cardiac arrest. She had a witnessed arrest while at work the evening of November 3rd, receiving approximately four minutes of CPR prior to EMS arrival. Her initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation, which responded to electrical defibrillation. She was taken to CCH, where she was found to be in complete heart block and hypotensive without purposeful movement. Coronary angiography showed no obstructive CAD. Left venticulography showed a reduced LVEF with two LV aneurysms. A temporary pacing wire was placed, she was given a continuous infusion of dopamine, and she was transferred to BWH. Ms. Wasielewski had reported subacute weight gain and fatigue leading up to the arrest on November 3rd. She additionally reported cough with white sputum and orthopnea.  


Ms. Wasielewski's past medical history includes alcohol abuse and ADHD. She has no medication allergies and takes only Ritalin at home. The medications at the time of transfer are dopamine infusion, midazolam infusion, aspirin 325mg daily, furosemide 20mg IV BID, bronchodilators, PPI, and vitamins. 


Ms. Wasielewski has a paternal uncle with what may be a dilated cardiomyopathy. There is no sudden death. She lives with her boyfriend in Hyannis and takes college course. She has history of heave EtOH use with her last drink in July. Current tobacco use.  


On exam, vital signs are 99.1  80  92/52  AC 450/16  FiO2 .4 SpO2 100%. She is intubated and sedated. Lungs with ventilated breath sounds. Normal S2/S2, regular, prominent A waves, III/VI SM at LLSB, JVP 10 cmH2O. Abdomen benign with no bruits. Extremities warm with trace edema and good distal pulses.

Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at 60BPM with complete heart block and right ventricular pacing at 80BPM.  


In summary, Ms. Wasielewski is a 36-year-old woman without prior cardiac history who is transferred from Cape Cod Hospital following a cardiac arrest. She remains pressor-dependent and in complete heart block with an as yet undefined neurological status. The cause of the arrest is not yet evident, though by history and ventriculogram there is evidence of at least a subacute process which could be idiopathic, toxin-mediated, inflammatory or infiltrative, eventually culminating in the dysrhythmia on the 3rd of this month. The structural abnormalities make purely arrhythmic causes such as long-QT less likely. The pace of this process does not suggest giant cell myocarditis, so we will defer endomyocardial biopsy while we pursue a basic diagnostic evaluation, beginning with laboratory studies and an echocardiogram, likely to be followed by cardiac MR. We will continue the transvenous pacing for now and assess the need for permanent pacing over the coming days. We will attempt to wean the dopamine; if we are unsuccessful, we will place a PA catheter to guide further inotropic and vasopressor support. An assessment of the neurological status is pressing and will be done overnight, though we are outside of the typical window for initation of therapeutic hypothermia. Once we have gathered more information and have a sense of the direction of Ms. Wasielewski's clinical course we will discuss the need for mechanical secondary prevention of sudden death with EP.

Inpatient Attending: James Kirshenbaum 

HPI (history per OSH records, patient's parents): Ms. Wasielewski is a 37F w/ a history of EtOH abuse s/p VF arrest and unstable PMVT c/b complete heart block and hypotension, who was transferred from an OSH to the CCU on dopamine and w/ pacing wire for further work-up and management.  About 1 month ago, she was started on bupropion for smoking cessation, and had a ~20lb weight gain over the next 2 weeks, leading her to discontinue the drug.  During this time she had malaise and felt generally unwell.  Thinking it may have been an allergic response, she took benadryl with minimal relief.  In the 5 days leading to her VF arrest on 11/3, she experienced a cough with whitish sputum that was worse while supine, and continued to retain weight. She also had subjective fevers and had discussed going in to the doctor on 11/3, but instead went to work at The Christmas Tree Store, where she arrested at 5pm.  She received ~4 minutes of CPR before EMS arrived and cardioverted her out of VF.  She was taken to Cape Cod hospital where she was noted to be in CHB, hypotensive, and minimally response with some 'seizure-like' activity.  She was intubated, started on dopamine, and taken to the cath lab.  There she had a temp wire placed and was found to have clean coronary arteries but an EF of 25% with dilated LV, global hypokinesis, and 2 LV aneurysms.  Her troponin was slightly positive at 0.212, BNP was 1240, and her urine tox and EtOH screens were negative.  She was transferred to BWH for further work-up and management.   


Of note, Ms. Wasielewski's last drink was in July, at which time she was hospitalized with EtOH poisoning (level 379).  During the same month, she was worked up for syncope/seizure and was noted on EKG to have RBBB and LAFB.

Imaging: 

CXR, TTE pending 


EKG: V paced at 80 w/ L bundle pattern.  P-waves at ~70, dissociated.  QT prolongation (529 QTc by Framingham correction: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23118006). Baseline from 7/2014: NSR w/ RBBB and LAFB.   


Assessment: 37F w/ baseline bifascicular block, h/o EtOH abuse s/p VF arrest and episode of PMVT i/s/o URI, c/b by CHB and hypotension requiring pacing wire and dopamine.   


Plan by Problems: 

#CVr: Per OSH report, s/p VF arrest, followed by CHB requring temporary pacing wire and an episode of PMVT.  Baseline rhythm 7/2014 of RBBB w/ LAFB.  Clean coronaries on LHC make ischemia unlikely.  No family history of sudden death, no EKG suggestion of familial disease. QT is prolonged, suggesting possible etiology. LHC showing enlarged heart w/ reduced EF suggestive of underlying CMP, predisposing to arrhythmia.  Possible causes in rough order of likelihood include EtOH (on/off abuse for 20 years), infectious myocarditis (URI symptoms w/ fever over the weekend), cocaine or ritalin abuse, infiltrative or autoimmune diseases, hypothyroidism, Takotsubo's (some non-apical ballooning/diverticuli on LHC, could represent arrythmogenic foci), and Giant cell myocarditis.  CHB could also be caused by Lyme or infiltrative disorders.   

Dx: 

- TSH, ANA, SPEP, ferritin, HIV, HCV, ACE level, Lyme, urine tox, methylphenidate level, coxsackie B ABs 

- monitor QT 

- EP consult in AM 

- TTE 

- consider cardiac MRI to further assess diverticuli/aneurysms in LV 

Tx: 

- continue pacing wire 

- K/Mg scales 


#CVp: No known history of CMP/CHF.  LHC at OSH showing EF 25% w/ dilated LV and 2 aneurysms/diverticuli.  Arrived to CCU on dopamine 5mcg/h.  Exam suggesting mildly volume up, and URI symptoms (cough, worse while supine) may have been 2/2 pulmonary edema.  Last month of malaise, feeling generally unwell may have been early HF symptoms, and CT chest at OSH suggestive of pulmonary edema w/ contrast reflux into IVC and hepatic veins.   

Dx: 

- TTE 

- nt-ProBNP 

- monitor UOP 

- consider cardiac MRI as above 

Tx: 

- wean dopamine as able for MAP>65 

- Lasix 20mg IV bolus; redose per TTE, UOP, exam 


#CVi: Troponins trended up from <0.046 on 11/3 to 0.170 and then 0.212 on 11/4, but LHC negative for coronary occlusion.  Most likely cause is her known CHB s/p arrest, w/ some additional leak from the cardioversion.  Other possible causes of troponemia include myocarditis, Takotsubo's, vasospasm. 

- trend troponin 

- cardiac work-up as above 


#Leukocytosis: Afebrile at OSH and on arrival; neutrophilic, likely in setting of post-arrest inflammatory state.  Could also be PNA given recent URI symptoms. 

- f/u CXR, UA 

- lactate 

- trend WBC 

- no antibiotics unless spikes 


#Ventilator: Was intubated in OSH ED d/t hypotension and unresponsiveness following brief 'seizure-like' activity.   - wean intubation to PSV from AC overnight, with plan for SAT/SBT in AM 


#Psychiatric: diagnosed with ADHD and ?bipolar.  Spent months in psychiatric hospital as a teen.  Had adverse response to wellbutrin (reportedly started for smoking cessation).   

- hold home methylphenidate 


#EtOH abuse: last drink in July when hospitalized for acute EtOH poisoning (EtOH 378).  On/off history of abuse since teenager, at least once w/ benzodiazepenes.   

- CTM 

- thiamine

Indications:  Gag reflex prevented mirror exam, Problem not seen well by non-endoscopic exam, unilateral symptoms r/o masses, lesions and or malignant process. 

Procedure: The patient was positioned comfortably in the SMR chair. Topical decongestant and anesthetic (1% lidocaine and oxymetazoline) was used to treat the nasal mucosa. The fiberoptic endoscope was passed via the floor of the nose under the inferior turbinate posteriorly. The patient was asked to breathe through the nose and the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses were evaluated. Then the 0 degree scope was withdrawn examining the fossa of Rosenmuller, Torus Tubarious, Eustachian tube opening, sphenoid sinus ostium, ethmoid infundibula, middle meatus, maxillary sinus antrum and nasal vestibule. The flexible laryngoscope was carefully removed at the end of the procedure.  

There were no complications. The patient was instructed not to eat or drink until the topical decongestant and anesthetic wears off.  

Findings:  Patient has a left-sided nasal mass that is emanating from the middle meatal area with prominent blood vessels, so no biopsy was attempted today.   


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient is a pleasant 83-year-old white male with extensive cardiac history with ejection fraction of 15%.  Patient is in the process of obtaining a pacemaker.  Once this is done and healed, he will benefit from a biopsy of his left nasal mass in the operating room, to r/o any malignant process and to have a better control in case of any nasal bleeding, Once we have a tissue diagnosis, then we can discuss further treatment options. 

We can try to do this under monitored anesthesia care, if he can not tolerate general anesthesia.  

Nose bleed-continue with conservative treatment.   

I discussed the risks benefits and alternatives of the proposed procedure.

This is an 83-year-old HSTH professor with cough and pulmonary consolidation.   


Patient had a successful trip to Cuba.  He also traveled to Mexico City, taking a concentrator with him to use when at altitude.  He continues with a cough without sputum production or at most scant clear sputum.  He has had no hemoptysis or chest pain.  He his breathless with walking.  He was able to walk from 45 to 15 Francis Street without stopping, but found his breathing labored.  On occasion, he notes aspiration of liquids.  He underwent chest CT scan earlier today.  He reports having had negative PPD skin test his last visit with a negative ANCA and low sedimentation rate arguing against vasculitis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis.  He has had left pleural effusion and associated round atelectasis for many years.  His left upper lobe consolidation with associated bulla formation is stable over several months when comparing his current chest CT scan with prior chest x-ray.   


On examination, this is an elderly man in no acute distress.  His weight 156.5 pounds and approximately stable blood pressure 116/68.  Pulse 71 and regular.  Respirations were unlabored at rest.  He had no adenopathy or jugular venous distention.  No cyanosis or clubbing.  Nares and pharynx benign.  Trachea midline and the thyroid not enlarged.  Chest:  Predominance of diminished breath sounds at the left base.  He had bronchial breath sounds in the left upper lung zone posteriorly.  Cardiac exam revealed a regular rhythm without murmur.  His abdomen was soft and nontender without hepatosplenomegaly and he had no peripheral edema.   


Oxygen saturation at rest was 100%.  Chest imaging was as described above with left pleural effusion, round atelectasis at left base.  There is dense consolidation at the left apex with associated bulla formation or cyst formation preferably in the left upper lobe.  This is to be compared with prior images.   


He appears to have a chronic process whose stability or slow change argues against malignancy or virulent infection.  I suspect that bronchoscopy and lung sampling will be necessary for additional diagnostic information.  However, he has a pacemaker placement planned for April 25 and by his report Dr. Tom Thomas plans a biopsy of a nasal pharyngeal mass thereafter.  My plan is to try and coordinate further pulmonary evaluation with his other providers including Dr. Richard Donahue, his primary care physician, Dr. Thomas, his otolaryngologist, and Dr. Tedrow and Dr. Stevenson, his cardiologist.  No additional testing was performed today, other than his CT scan.

he has a history of a distant anterior myocardial infarction prior to a bypass surgery in 2000.  At that time, he had a total occlusion of the LAD at the takeoff, proximal 90% stenosis of the circumflex, third obtuse marginal branch with an 80% proximal and 60% distal stenosis, small right coronary artery with diffuse disease, and an ejection fraction at that time of 25% with no aortic valve gradient.  He underwent CABG with a LIMA to the LAD, and a vein graft to the OM1 and to the PDA. When I first saw him in January 2014,  he had no recent chest discomfort, but had several episodes during a recent trip to a hot climate.  We performed a stress MIBI with these results:

 The combined extent and severity of ischemia plus scar during
     stress was severely abnormal involving 35.3% of myocardium (summed
     stress score:  24).  The magnitude of reversible ischemia from
     stress to rest was mild involving 2.9% of myocardium (summed
     difference score:      
       Gated SPECT:     
     Demonstrated a post-stress LV ejection fraction of 20% and ESVI 144
     ml/m
     hypokinesis, with akinesis of the mid and apical anterior,
     anteroseptal walls, apical LV segments and the LV apex, all showing
     reduced regional wall thickening.  The RV function appeared normal.


He has had no further chest discomfort since that time.


Complicating Pulmonary History:  In 2003, he presented with a chronic left pleural effusion, which was drained, and a biopsy showed fibrosing pleuritis  When he presented in 2012 with cholecystitis, a chest x-ray showed progressive loss of left lung volume with retraction in the upper lobe and changes in the lower lobe.  CT scans of the chest at that time revealed possible microabscesses in the left upper lobe, which have subsequently been evaluated by pulmonary consultation. Complete pulmonary function tests in 2012 showed a vital capacity of 51%, peak flow 81%, improving 9% with a bronchodilator, diffusion capacity decreased to 72% 


Medical therapy for HF: When I saw him in January,  his jugular venous pressure was slightly elevated, about 9-10 with + HJR,  so I increased his lasix from 80 or 120 mg to 80 mg twice daily.  He lost a couple of pounds immediately, which have stayed off. He feels that he is less likely to get short of breath with mild or no activity.  His dyspnea during walking is unchanged.   Note that at the same time I decreased his carvedilol from 50 bid to 50 at night and 25 in the morning, hoping to diminish some of the severe fatigue he describes.  He is not sure which of these made the improvements in his dyspnea.   


Device Therapy for HF;

He was scheduled to have CRT, but it was deferred due to the new chest discomfort.  Now with the MIBI showing no areas of critical ischemia warranting intervention,  it will be rescheduled for the near future.  He clearly understands the distinction between CRT and ICD, and indicates that he wants the device to help him feel better and do more,  not to rescue him from natural death.

pulmonary artery systolic pressure is moderately elevated at 55.7 mmHg.
lAssessment and Plan 

Patient with slight improvement after increasing diuretic and decreasing beta blocker dose. Still severe exercise limitation - with QRS 190 and LBBB, favorable factors for good clinical response to CRT, which he will proceed to reschedule.  He still may have slightly elevated filling pressures but with the postural decline,  will not increase diuretics further.  Plan to r-evaluate after 3 months of CRT or sooner if symptoms worsen.

Dear Dr. Lynne, 


Today, we dealt with Paul Giacobbe's CRT-D primary implant.  It was an exceptionally arduous maneuver.  I have indicated in e-mail correspondence, he has one of the most adversely remodeled left ventricle that I have ever encountered.  His left ventricle was massive and has expanded posteriorly in the left chest wall, such that even in a 90 degree LAO projection, we could not see the posterior wall of the LV.  The consequence of this is that the coronary sinus ostium had a markedly displaced origin, which was paradoxically directly over the spine in the anterior-posterior projection, but then traveled in a front to back direction from the lateral point of view, which made engagement exceptionally difficult.  We actually were going to give up after about 2 hours to trying and then using a novel delivery stumbled into the coronary sinus.  Unfortunately, before that, we had dissected a large portion of the coronary sinus, so manipulations were extremely limited.  I consider myself lucky to have gotten angioplasty wire past the dissection and over that, we placed a left ventricular pacing lead that I believe is at the base of the left ventricle in the anterior vein.  I do not believe it reaches the posterior wall.  We never visualized target veins reaching the posterior wall due to the venous dissection. 


Other challenges related to the fact that he has frequent intermittent high-grade AV block even when the sinus rate is 130 or 140 beats per minute, therefore high adrenergic tone.  This was not a problem during the procedure because we had 2 sources of backup ventricular pacing in place.  However, I suspect he has been having intermittent heart block as an outpatient that was unnoticed. 


My interpretation of the results thus far is a qualified success.  In the sense that he has a functioning left ventricular pacing lead, but probably not in the best site for reversing left ventricular conduction delay due to left bundle-branch block.  On the other hand, he has so much left ventricular conduction delay that perhaps this site will be adequate.  I would recommend that if after 6 months, we have observed no reverse remodeling that we take him up for placement of epicardial pacemaker leads through a thoracoscopic approach under general anesthesia in the cardiac operating room.  This eliminates the need for thoracotomy which dramatically reduces surgical recovery. 


On the other hand, if he has a remodeling response or I suppose if he is clinically improved even in the absence of remodeling and we are certain it is not a psychological fact, then we could leave things as is. 


He is going to remain with us overnight.  Of course, I will see him within 10-14 days time and I will take a close look at his QRS fusion pattern with the current lead configuration.  See my comments above; if we are lucky he will get by as is alternately given the advanced state of his cardiomyopathy and a tremendous amount left ventricular conduction delay he has, I personally would not hesitate to move on to a second maneuver to achieve optimal positioning for left ventricular stimulation. 


Sincerely,

Dear Lynne: 


Thanks for sending Paul Giacobbe to see us today to discuss the role of cardiac resynchronization therapy/defibrillation in the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death associated with chronic dilated cardiomyopathy and left bundle-branch block heart failure.  We spent about 30 minutes with he and his wife, who attended him today, and he came well prepared and well educated about resynchronization therapy and optimistic about his odds for improvement. 


He is 55 years old.  He has a severely remodeled left ventricle, an ejection fraction in the range of 15-20% with mechanical asynchrony attributable to his left bundle-branch block.  These disruptions to normal heart function have persisted for months, despite good medical therapy. 


You and I discussed his 12-lead ECG, which shows typical left bundle-branch block modified by apical anterior, superior and lateral scar.  He has a large amount of left ventricular conduction delay, which exceeds 100 milliseconds, and also a large amount of myocardial scar. 


The diagnosis of left bundle-branch block was made in 2008 in the context of a workup for brain tumor.  The record clearly indicates that he did not have left bundle-branch block and 2007.  Since he does not have coronary artery disease, there was some thought that perhaps his cardiomyopathy is related to left bundle-branch block alone; having said that, he had an MRI that indicated some evidence of myocardial scar and certainly, his 12-lead ECG displays a large amount of myocardial scar.  Thus, he most likely has a primary cardiomyopathy of some sort. 


His current medications appear to be digoxin, lisinopril, and Toprol from the standpoint of cardiac management. 


We had a very lengthy discussion about the intent of resynchronization therapy as regards electromechanical resynchronization of left ventricular function with the expectation of improvement in left ventricular size and function and remediation of heart failure symptoms.  In his case, what he has going for him is a large amount of left ventricular conduction delay and against him, a large amount of left ventricular scar.  If we achieved perfect electrical resynchronization, which is not predictable, his odds of reverse remodeling are probably about 60-70% over the next 9 months or so.  We also discussed the importance of defibrillation support in the event of a cardiac arrest.  He had a very good understanding of this. 


He is a sophisticated individual, designs and implements large scale computer applications.  We spent a fair amount of time talking about the persistent challenges of coronary venous pacing, which he expressed a good understanding. 


He also understands, as does his other caregivers, that he can no longer have an MRI after a CRT-D defibrillator is inserted.  He says that he has had an MRI, relatively recently and everyone who was following, agrees that no further MRIs are needed at this time and therefore, he is free to proceed with defibrillator implantation. 


After I obtain your approval, I will make arrangements for CRT-D system implantation, which he would like done at earliest convenience. 


Sincerely,

I appreciate Dr. Kendrick's insight into  Mr. Giaccobe's recent status, and have discussed our visit today with him, plans as below.  

Patient now ready to proceed with BiV ICD placement, after recent negative brain MRI.  History of Present Illness 

His left bundle was first seen in 2008 at the top of screening prior to his surgery for brain tumor,  did not have LBBB in 2007. This may in fact have contributed to his current cardiac limitation.  He had an ejection fraction of 15% in 2010, without any evidence of coronary artery disease, mid wall enhancement on MRI suggestive of chronic cardiomyopathy.  From a clinical standpoint,  the issues have been complex due to his history of brain tumor, with potential indication for further  MRI scanning  for both his seizures and the likelihood of recurrent glioma, now in remission for almost 5 years. This has limited his consideration of Bi-V pacing(with ICD), which we feel could improve his cardiac function.  He has just had another brain MRI that shows no evidence of tumor recurrence. 


He returns today ready to have the BiV ICD.  In the meantime,  he had resumed beer drinking when we saw him last,  is now using antabuse and has not had beer for 4 months.

He has a history of occasional palpitations,  none seen here, but apparently had been seen in AFib somewhere in past.  He had recent palpitations for a night and Dr. Kendrick noted him to have frequent PAC's and perhaps short runs of atrial fibrillation.   He has had relatively rapid rate in sinus rhythm as well in the past, which we have tried to address by gradual increase of beta blocker and addition of digoxin.  He has had no symptoms of TIAs or syncope.  


He has diagnosis of sleep apnea for which he is not using his CPAP, indicating that he does not need it when his weight in under 240 pounds.  However, he is currently 244 and his wife indicates that she notes the abnormal breathing frequently during the night.  We have emphasized the potential relationship between AFib and his sleep apnea and the importance of using his CPAP.


He is doing no regular exercise except 4 block dog walk, although he built an elaborate video console around the stationery bike.  He indicates that he watches TV most of the day, with the shades down, or naps,  and has trouble sleeping for which he is using combinations of librium and ambien.  We have discussed sleep hygiene in terms of light rhythms,  daytime exercise,  avoiding naps. Problems

Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is moderately to severely dilated. There

We pent 45 minutes reviewing the situation and the plans. He appears well compensated now and is in SR today 100 with frequent PAC's ,  prominent right atrum,  PR interval of > 200 msec,  IVCD of 176 msec which is not RBBB but atypical for LBBB

Although we had initially understood that he had actually been in atrial fibrllation,  discussion with Dr. Kendrick reveals that he has had frequent PACs but not sustained AFib,  so we do not think it is urgent that he have systemic anticoagulation at this time.   Thus we will refer him now for BiV ICD with Dr. Michaud.   If he develops atrial fibrillation in the future,  anticoagulation could be initiated at that time.  In the meantime,  we have recommended increase of metoprolol to 25 mg in AM, 50 mg in PM.

Dear Garrick: 


I had the pleasure of seeing Mary Towle at Brigham and Women's Hospital today for evaluation for a CRT-defibrillator.  As you know, she is a 69-year-old disgnosed with LBBB in 4/2008.  She had a normal nuclear perfusion study at the time and was told that this was "just an electrical problem".  She then developed HTN and was treated over the years with lisinipril and HCTZ.She had an echocardiogram in August of this year that showd an EF of 25% at an outside hospital.    She was diagnosed with reduced ejection fraction in early 09/20/13 on the backdrop of a 5-year history of left bundle-branch block.  On october 24th she was documented to have an EF of 35%.  Repeat echo december 4th showed EF 25%.   She is NYHA class II. 


She had a PET CT were normal and suggest no evidence of flow-limiting coronary artery disease. (cardiac cath was not performed due to a history of aspirin allergy.  In addition, she had a coronary calcium score of 0 and normal coronary flow reserve, all findings consistent with a nonischemic cardiomyopathy.  She did have abnormal global LV systolic function on this test with an estimated ejection fraction of approximately 35%. 


Medications include carvedilol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., lisinopril 10 mg daily, and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily. 


Family History: 

nonischemic cardiomyopathy in 1 son and another sund with sudden death.  3 other healthy children.  She has multiple family members with LBBB  

her son, James, who is in his late 40s, also has a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, left bundle-branch block, and has received cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator and has had an improvement in his ejection fraction with medical therapy.  Given the multigenerational history and the sudden death of her other son, it is possible that she may have a familial cardiomyopathy syndrome.  We suspect that up to a third of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathies may have a genetic basis.  I will discuss with Mrs. Towle in December whether she wants to see one of our genetic cardiomyopathy specialist for consideration of further family testing.  Mrs. Towle has 3 other adult children as well as 10 grandchildren 


Shx: registered nurse, works 2d/week in assisted living. No tobacco, no ETOH.  Lives in sutton with her husband.  


Physical Examination:  On physical examination today, her blood pressure is 130/58 with a pulse of 76 beats per minute, weight of 211 pounds, unchanged from her last visit.  She is alert and oriented x3 in no acute distress.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive with anicteric sclerae, corrective lenses are in place.  Oropharynx is moist and dry.  Jugular venous pressure is less than 6 without Kussmaul sign or hepatojugular reflux.  She has 2+ carotid upstrokes without audible bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2.  There is no audible murmur, rub, or gallop today.  Abdomen is obese and nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm.  There is trace pedal edema with 1+ posterior tibialis pulses.  No clubbing or cyanosis.  Normal finger-to-nose, normal strength and tone, with intact cranial nerves and has a bright affect. 


Electrocardiography today is normal sinus rhythm at 76 beats per minute with underlying left bundle-branch block, QRS duration of 162 milliseconds.  This is unchanged from her prior tracing from September, 20 2013. 


In summary, Mrs. Towle is a 69-year-old woman with New York Heart Association class II functional capacity and a nonischemic cardiomyopathy associated with left bundle-branch block.  She is an appopriate candidate for a CRT defribrillator which we have reviewed today and will schedule for jan 15

Dear Dr. Hammouda: 


I had the pleasure of seeing Mary Towle today in the Advanced Heart Disease Clinic at Brigham and Women's Hospital for a follow up appointment. As you know, she is a 69 year-old female with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension and a 5 year history of left bundle-branch block. She is a semi-retired nurse who continues to work 2 days a week at an assisted living facility. At her last clinic visit on 10/27/2013 her carvedilol was increased to 12.5 mg twice daily. She has tolerated the increase without any issues. A repeat echocardiogram was performed prior to today's visit to reassess her ventricular function. The results are currently pending. 


On review of symptoms today, she denies any orthopnea, PND, lower extremity swelling, weight loss or gain, chest pains, palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, or syncope. She denies any cough, fever or chills. She can climb a flight of stairs and is able to perform her activities of daily living without limitations. She is walking 1 to 1.5 miles twice a week. She plans to increase the amount of days that she is walking as an effort to lose weight. She is able to sleep flat in bed with one pillow. She states that her appetite is good. She denies any early satiety, abdominal bloating, nausea or vomiting. She reports compliance with her 2 gram sodium diet as well as her 2 liter fluid restriction. She has no intolerance's to her current medication regimen. All other systems were reviewed and are negative.

Impression and Plan 

In summary,  Ms. Towle is a 69 year-old female with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension and a 5 year history of left bundle-branch block. An echocardiogram was performed at Brigham and Women's Hospital earlier today for reassessment of her cardiac function. Results are currently pending. If her ejection fraction remains less than 35%, given her chronic left bundle branch block and QRS duration of 162 millisecond she may be eligible for consideration of ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy. 


On examination today, she appears euvolemic and well perfused. She remains New York Heart Association functional class II. Her blood pressure is well controlled.  

We will titrate her lisinopril to 15 mg daily. She will remain on hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. She will continue on her current dose of carvedilol. I reinforced heart failure teaching today. She reports compliance with her medications as well as her dietary and fluid restrictions. We will draw a basic metabolic panel today to assess her renal function and electrolyte status. Once the results of her echocardiogram are available, the plan moving forward will be discussed with Dr. Garrick Stewart. She will schedule a follow up clinic visit with Dr. Stewart in 2-3 months.  


Thank you for allowing me to participate in Ms. Towel's care. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.  

Sincerely,

CHIEF COMPLAINT: CRT-D Pacemaker Upgrade 

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: 

76 year old man with CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG and LV aneurysectomy in 6/06, CHF EF 20-25% s/p VT/VF arrest leading to dual chamber ICD 6/07, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who is transferred to the SDU s/p ICD upgrade to CRT-D.  


He was admitted to MGH in Feb 2012 with chest pain. Cardiac cath showed stable CAD, and no intervention was performed. 


ICD Device Interrogation on 8/30/12 showed battery approaching ERI. Pt had appt with Dr. Heist on same day, described that he been feeling SOB for past 6-7 months. Would be SOB at rest, would get SOB w/ miminal exertion (with talking alone, tying his shoes, going up 12 steps from his cellar). Denies any chest pain, pressure. Rare dry cough, dry. Given his worsening symptoms, Heist recommended ICD upgrade. 


In the EP Lab, the decision was made to add a new RA lead out of concern for possible poor function the the existing lead. An additional coronary sinus lead was placed and the generator was replaced. Access was obtained through the axillary vein. He was given Vancomycin prophylaxis given a history of penicillin allergies. He tolerated the procedure well without complications.

He has 9 living siblings and several have CAD

 Social history:
 Remote cigars in his late 20s. No EtOH. Works as a meat cutter part time for Stop and Shop, side business of auto repairs. Lives with wife. I daughter Mallory who is a nurse. 2 grandsons.

 Review of systems:
 A 10 system review was performed, and was within normal limits except as described above.

Physical Exam 
BP 112/80 mmHg 134/67
Pulse 63 bpm 83
weight 165 lb 
height 65 in 
BMI 27.5 Overweight, moderate risk. 
General No acute distress.
HEENT Unremarkable
Neck Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.
Chest Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 or S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.
Abdomen Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.
Extremities No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ R femoral pulse without bruit. 2+ pedal pulses.
Neuro AO x3

 EKG:
 Sinus rhythm at 63 bpm with PACs. LBBB. PR 194, QRS 188 ms. QTc 501 ms.

 Assessment and plan:
 - Inactivated 

Problems: 
Left heart failure - Given NYHA Class II-III CHF, with LVEF in the 20s and LBBB with QRS duration of 188 ms, he meets all criteria for upgrade of his ICD to a CRT-ICD. Of note, he has atrial lead noise, and so would also benefit from a new atrial lead. I spoke to him and his daughter about this at length, including the risks and benefits of the procedure, and they would like to go forward. He may be a candidate for the DIRECT clinical study.

Mr. Luis Rijo returns for followup.  He is a 74-year-old man status post CABG with ischemic cardiomyopathy.  We have been advancing his cardiomyopathy medicine since his recent diagnosis in the past year of severely depressed systolic function.  We have also been trying to get an ICD device in place, but it has been challenging for many reasons.  There has been travel and then influenza and then cerebrovascular accident, but it appears he will be having this tomorrow.  Since his discharge for his new right parietal right insula infarct, he has been feeling well.  He was seen last week for some lightheadedness and his spironolactone time of day was adjusted.  He is currently on spironolactone and Toprol, and we have not instituted an angiotensin receptor blocker yet.  I think we will want to do this after his ICD is in place given all of these recent events.  He reports that he is having no chest discomfort and his pulmonary symptoms have improved, although he feels a bit fatigued.  He is not having paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea. 


Today, on physical examination, heart rate is 60 and regular, blood pressure 138/61.  Chest is clear to auscultation and percussion.  Jugular venous pressure is 7 cm of water.  Normal carotid upstrokes without bruits.  Normal PMI.  Normal S1 with paradoxical splitting of S2.  There is a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base of the heart.  No diastolic murmur is audible.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  No pedal edema. 


His cardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation at -73 degrees.  Intervals are 0.16/0.19/0.49 and there is left bundle-branch block. 


Mr. Rijo is going to have a CRT device placed tomorrow by Dr. Bruce Koplan of our EP service.  He has ischemic cardiomyopathy and he is on spironolactone, atorvastatin, aspirin, Lasix and Toprol.  We will likely advance his Toprol and consider adding an ARB this year depending on his response to the CRT.  He will return to see me in a month.

HPI:  

 74 year old Spanish speaking M with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, CAD, HTN, prior R parital and cerebellar CVA, HL who presents with syncopal event. Patient states he was just discharged from the hospital yesterday. This am he awoke around 7:00am.  He was able to talk with a friend at that time.  He then went to use the bathroom and afterward had loss of conciousness.  EMS was called and found the patient awake and alert. He was brought to the BWH ED where he was noted to have SBPs in the 120s.  On the ED exam he was noted to have possible L sided weakness of unclear duration and an acute stroke was called.  On examination by neuro team, he was noted to have a subtle L facial droop (but good activation) and L dysmetria. NIHSS 2.  He was taken to head CT which showed the old R sided stroke (which the team was not aware of at the time of evaluation) and no hemorrhage. The pateint stated that he was feeling at his baseline. 

  Of note, he was recently hospitalized for syncope and admitted to medicine. He was not found to have any arrhythmias on monitoring and troponins were negative x 2.  He had a TTE which showed an EF 25-30% with moderate MR and global LV systolic dysfunction. Influenza PCR testing showed the patient was positive H1N1 and he was started on tamiflu. CXR showed a possible LLL infiltrate and he was started on levaquin 750mg daily for a planned 5 day course. His lasix was held during his admission but restarted today.  He is scheduled for a CRT-D in 2-3 weeks.

Assessment:  

74 year old with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, prior R parietal and bilateral cerebellar strokes who presents with syncope. The history of his old stroke was not known at time of initial evaluation, and he was called as a possible acute stroke. However, on further chart review, it appears he has prior R sided infarcts as well as bilateral cerebellar infarcts, which likely explain the deficits seen on exam. Exam is limited by translation and unclear history of his baseline. I do not suspect that this event represents a new stroke, though exam is limited. His syncope may have been due to restarting his lasix or possible dehydration in the setting of recent illness.   


Plan:  

- MRI when able, but low suspicion for new stroke 

- continue aspirin 

- syncope workup per ED team 


Thank you for this consult. Please page 31381 with any questions or concerns while the patient is still in ED.

Addendum - Admit to CMF  


Name: RIJO,LUIS 

MRN: 13375886(BWH) 

Date: 02/26/2014 


HPI: Agree with note above. Briefly, 74 year old, Spanish-speaking gentleman, who has a history of CAD (3v CABG, PCA x 2), iCMP (EF 25%), prior R parital and cerebellar CVA recent admission 2/24 for syncope who presents with a recurrent episode of syncope.   

This AM he awoke around 7:00am.  He was able to talk with a friend at that time.  He then went to use the bathroom and afterward had loss of consciousness.  EMS was called and found the patient awake and alert. He was brought to the BWH ED where he was noted to have SBPs in the 120s.  On the ED exam he was noted to have possible L sided weakness of unclear duration and an acute stroke was called.  On examination by neuro team, he was noted to have a subtle L facial droop (but good activation) and L dysmetria. NIHSS 2.  He was taken to head CT which showed the old R sided stroke (which the team was not aware of at the time of evaluation) and no hemorrhage. The patient stated that he was feeling at his baseline. 

During his recent admission, the patient presented to BWH ED after two episodes of syncope in the setting of rising from a chair. He had not been feeling well for a few days and had not eaten anything on the day of admission and the day prior. On the day of admission he was rising from a seated position, had a prodrome of dizziness, light-headedness, and then lost consciousness.   

He was placed on telemetry, which showed no concerning arrhythmias. His first two sets of cardiac biomarkers were negative, and the patient underwent TTE, which showed no significant change compared to his prior study here on 3/22/2012. The LV was mildly dilated and there was severe global LV systolic dysfunction, moderate MR, mild TR, mild to moderate AI, and estimated LVEF is 25-30%. Influenza PCR testing showed the patient was positive for H1N1 influenza, and he was started on Tamiflu for a total 5-day course. CXR also showed possible developing left lower lobe infiltration, and the patient was started on Levaquin 750mg daily for a total 5 day course to treat presumptive community-acquired pneumonia. The patient's home lasix was held on admission due to concern for poor PO intake, but was reinitiated the day after discharge. He was discharged from the ED and did not spend the night.

IMPRESSION:
     1. Acute infarction involving the right posterior insula and
     right parietal lobe including the lateral postcentral gyrus.
     2. Prior right parieto-occipital, right cerebellar, and left
     cerebellar infarcts with associated encephalomalacia and gliosis.
     3. Multifocal mild atherosclerotic disease of the anterior and
     posterior intracranial circulations.
     4. Mild stenosis of the left subclavian origin and moderate
     stenosis of the right carotid bulb.
     5. Moderate to severe paranasal sinus disease with moderate
     bilateral mastoid effusions 


Echo TTE 2/24/14 

Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is mildly dilated. There is normal left 
ventricular wall thickness. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection 
fraction is severely reduced at 25-30%. There is global hypokinesis with 
regional variation. The left ventricular diastolic function appears 
abnormal, as indicated by the mitral inflow and tissue Doppler signals. 
There is evidence of impaired relaxation with spectral and/or tissue 
Doppler, consistent with diastolic dysfunction.

Right Ventricle: The right ventricular size is normal. Global RV systolic 
function is normal.
Left Atrium: There is moderate left atrial enlargement.
Right Atrium: The right atrium is normal in size.

Comparison /Summary: A prior study was performed on 3/22/2012. Compared with 
the prior study there has been no significant change. The LV is mildly 
dilated and there is severe global LV systolic dysfunction with minor 
regional variability. The estimated LVEF is 25-30%. RV size and systolic 
function are normal. MOderate MR, mild TR, mild to moderate AI 



Assessment:  

Pt is a 74 year old, Spanish-speaking gentleman, who has a history of CAD (3v CABG, PCA x 2), iCMP (EF 25%), prior R parital and cerebellar CVA recent admission 2/24 for syncope who presents with a recurrent episode of syncope and is found to have a new acute infarct in the R partietal lobe. Stroke mechanism could be secondary to either artery to artery embolism vs cardioembolic. Pt has evidence of both intracranial atherosclerosis as well as a poor EF putting him at risk for cardioembolic events  It is possible that he is slightly more hypercoagulable given his influenza infection and dehydration.   


Plan:  

Neurology:  

-Increased Aspirin to 325mg PO  

- Increase statin to Atorvastatin 80mg 

-Continue to monitor on telemetry, EKG 

- Lipids, TSH  

-Speech therapy, PT and OT evaluation 


CV:  

- Pt with slight elevation in troponin, likely demand ischemia. Will continue to trend until troponins peak 

-Let blood pressure autorregulate, but continue Spironolactone and Metoprolol for cardiac protection 

- Hold home lasix for now 

,-Telemetry monitoring 

- NT pro-BNP to assess for CHF 


Pulmonary: 

-Aspiration precautions: HOB > 30 degrees 

-Supplemental O2 as needed 


GI:  

- Bedside swallow  

-Diet as per speech recommendations 


ID: 

- Continue Tamiflu through 2/28 

- Continue Levofloxacin through 2/28 


Endocrine:  

-Finger stick blood glucose target: 90-180 

-f/u HA1c 


FEN:  

-Monitor electrolytes including Ca, Mg and Phosphorus 

-Replete Mg and K as appropriate. 


Heme: 

-Monitor CBC and coags 


Prophylaxis: 

-Consider PPI 

-Colace, senna prn 

-TEDs, boots, and prophylactic Lovenox

PATIENT NAME:  RIJO,LUIS 

MRN:  13375886(BWH) 

Date of Birth:  08/08/39 


ATTENDING: 


SERVICE:  Cardiology 


REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Syncope 


CC: Syncope 


HPI: Mr. Rijo is a 74 year old, Spanish-speaking gentleman, who has a history of CAD (3v CABG, PCA x 2), iCMP (EF 30%), and is scheduled for CRT-D tomorrow, who presents to BWH ED after two episodes of syncope in the setting of rising from a chair.  He has not been feeling well for a few days now (he says 3-4 days likely), which is described as a generalized malaise, productive cough, raspy voice.  He did not eat anything on the day of admission, as he had no appetite, and also did not each much the day before for the same reason.  On the day of admission he was rising from a seated position, had a prodrome of dizziniess, light-headedness, and then lost consciousness (unknown time of being unconscious).  After he awoke he did not feel himself entirely, but there is no report of any head trauma or strike.  His daughter is with him, and says that his biggest complaint is that he did not walk correctly, being that he walked kind of unstably.  She then said that this has been going on for quite some time, nearly a year, but more recently had been exacerbated.   


He is aware of his location during our interview, and also able to answer questions direclty without pausing.  He does not have any chest pain or pressure, no palpitations currently or immediately after the event.  He had been feeling some fevers and chills for the last few days, and lives with his grandchildren (6 months and 20 months old), who are often sick with sniffles and the flu (per their mother who is present for the interview).  He has not used any antibiotics recently, but did travel to the Dominican Republic in January.   


There is no report of loss of bowel/bladder continence, post-ictal period when he awoke, turning his head quickly preceding the syncopal event.   


He had a hospitalization in the Dominican Republic in early January for acute heart failure, for which he had medications changed and digoxin started.  While there, he spent 2 days in the ICU, and then 3 days on the regular ward.  He was found to have an EF of 27%, which was consistent with past BWH studies.  In follow up with his cardiologist Dr. Richard T. Lee he did not have his digoxin continued, but it was decided that he should go forward with a CRT-D implantation. 


He was scheduled for a CRT-D to be placed on 2/25/2014 with Dr. Koplan.

Type:  Chest PA  AND  Lateral
Date/Time:  02/24/2014 03:54
     FINDINGS: 2 views of the chest demonstrate multiple mediastinal
     clips in keeping with prior CABG. Intact median sternotomy wires
     are noted. The lungs are moderately inflated without pneumothorax
     or pleural effusion. No focal consolidation concerning for
     pneumonia. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta
     are noted.

     IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
     process seen. 


EKG:  LBBB (seen previously), with biggest change from prior being slightly up-sloping ST-segments in V4, V5 


Type: MIBI 

Date: 5/1/2013 

 In summary, the test results were:

     1. Symptomatic response:  Consistent with Adenosine.
     2. Peak Blood Pressure: 157/67 mm Hg.
     3. Blood pressure response: Not applicable due to vasodilator
     stress.
     4. ECG response:  Non-diagnostic test due to LBBB.
     5. Stress-induced arrhythmia:  PVC's.
     6. Myocardial Perfusion:  Abnormal.
     7. Global LV Function:  Abnormal.

     Final impression:

     1.  The patient's test results are abnormal and consistent with a
     medium to large sized region of myocardial scar with mild
     peri-infarct ischemia in the distribution of a ramus/diagonal
     coronary artery.

     2.  Severely abnormal global LV systolic function.

     3.  The results are changed from his prior study of Feb 2, 2012, in
     that there is less ischemia on the current study. 


Type: TTE 

Date: 3/2012  

Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is mildly dilated. There is normal left 
ventricular wall thickness. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection 
fraction is severely reduced at 30%. There is global hypokinesis with 
regional variation. The inferior and septal walls appear most severely 
impaired. Abnormal (paradoxical) motion consistent with left bundle branch 
block.

Right Ventricle: The right ventricular size is normal. Global RV systolic 
function is low normal.
Left Atrium: There is borderline left atrial enlargement.
Right Atrium: The right atrium is normal.
Aortic Valve: The aortic valve is tricuspid and mildly thickened. There is 
no evidence of aortic stenosis. There is moderate aortic valve regurgitation.
Mitral Valve: The mitral valve is mildly diffusely thickened. Mitral valve 
closure is apically displaced and is consistent with tethering of the mitral 
apparatus, annular dilatation, and/or left ventricular enlargement. 
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation is present.
Tricuspid Valve: The tricuspid valve is structurally normal. Mild to 
moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation is present. The tricuspid regurgitant 
velocity is 2.24 m/s, consistent with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
of 20 mmHg plus right atrial pressure.
Pulmonic Valve: There is no obvious pulmonic valve abnormality. There is no 
pulmonic stenosis. There is no pulmonary valve regurgitation.
Aorta: The aortic root size is normal, measuring 3.30 cm at the Sinuses of 
Valsalva. The ascending aorta is normal, and measures 3.40 cm. The aortic 
arch is not well visualized.
Venous: The inferior vena cava is normal in size.
Pericardium/Pleura: No significant pericardial effusion is seen.


ASSESSMENT: 

74 year old male with CAD (s/p 3v CABG, PCA x 2), iCMP (EF of 30%), and planned for CRT-D who presents with syncopal episode in the setting of recent history of fevers/chills, poor PO intake, and rising from a seated position. 


PLAN: 

# CVr/Syncope: Etiology is consistent with extracellular volume depletion leading to orthostatic hypotension, however more sinister causes cannot be ruled out given his significant history of CAD, therefore such things as arrythmia, valvular pathology will be investigated.  Carotid hypersensitivity, seizure, exertional dyspnea all do not fit with history. 

diagnostically 

- EKG in ED showed 

- telemetry showed no events in ED, will continue on floor 

- 1st set of biomarkers non-elevated, will check 2nd set to ensure no worry of ischemia 

- TTE in AM 

- check orthostatics on arrival to floor 

therapeutically 

- keep K > 4, Mg > 2 

- was scheduled for CRT-D on 2/25/2014, consult EP or email Dr. Koplan for possible implantation while in house 

- based on orthostatics, may provide IV hydration 

- hold furosemide on admission, evaluate utility of it after orthostatic vital signs obtained 


# CVi: Has significant known CAD and stable angina 

- 2nd set of biomarkers to fully evaluate for ischemic damage 

- continue ASA, atorvastatin 

- cont. home SL NTG PRN 


# CVp: EF of 30% on last TTE at BWH, as well as recently done in Dominican Republic, where he had hospitalization in early January for acute worsening of heart failure.  On admission with NT-BNP of 1247 (no baseline), but JVP non-elevated and creatinine slightly up.  

- TTE in AM 

- hold home furosemide 20mg, decide on diuretic regimen after orthostatic vital signs 

- continue home spironolactone 25mg 


# ID: Some concern for pneumonia on CXR, but repeat image showed likely atelectasis.  History of concerning for viral etiology of fevers/chills given symptoms complex and exposure history.  Also tender in LLQ, but no other GI symptoms to suggest diverticulitis. 

- viral swabs taken in ED, PCR pending 

- hold on antibiotics currently, pending clinical course 

- given history of > 3 days of symptoms will not treat empirically with oseltamivir 


Hospital Issues: 

F - decide on IV fluids after orthostatic vital signs done 

E - K > 4, Mg > 2, on scales 

N - House diet, low fat, low salt 


PPx:  

DVT - hold on heparin in case CRT-D placement done on this admission, TEDs written for

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Rijo returns for followup.  He is a 74-year-old man with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy.  He has not yet had his ICD arranged but Dr. Koplan is doing this today.  He has had many medication adjustments recently due to hospitalization in the Dominican Republic, and I have been wary to adjust his medications without actually seeing the bottles as there has been some confusion.  In fact, it appears that the local pharmacists have been refusing to give some of his medications to him because of some confusion.  He did bring his bottles with him today and through his daughter and an interpreter, I got a good picture of his medication regimen.  Currently, he is not having paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea, although he does have more dyspnea when he is walking. 


MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg daily, furosemide 20 mg daily, Lipitor 40 mg nightly, spironolactone 25 mg daily, and metoprolol sustained release 50 mg per day. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His weight is 156 pounds and his heart rate is 60 and regular.  Respiration rate 14.  Blood pressure 134/71.  Jugular venous pressure is 5 cm of water.  Normal carotid upstrokes without bruits.  Chest is clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiac examination reveals normal PMI and there is an S4 gallop.  He has a normal S1 with a 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base.  There is no pedal edema at all.  His cardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 and left bundle-branch block with QRS complex of 0.19. 


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Rijo has dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy and we will check his electrolytes today and gradually add back angiotensin receptor blockade over the next month.  It appears that his pharmacy has not been giving him digoxin (by my review of his medication bottles, and comparing with hospital records from the Dominican Republic), and since he is not in heart failure currently, I think we can leave this off as we will be having him takes several medications that can affect electrolytes.  I will check his electrolytes today and he will return to the office next week for medication adjustments.  Most likely I will add back an angiotensin receptor blocker.  He will have BiV device arranged by Dr. Koplan.

Mr. Luis Rijo returns for followup.  I saw him last week after he returned from the Dominican Republic and tried to reconcile his medications.  Unfortunately, there has been some confusion regarding his new medicines and his old medicines and he forgot to bring his medication bottles with him today.  Through his daughter, he reports that he is feeling well, although occasionally he has labored breathing.  He has no orthopnea or syncope.  He is awaiting to hear from the EP Service about his ICD device. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His heart rate is 65, blood pressure 139/68.  Chest is clear except for occasional rales at both bases.  Jugular venous pressure is 8 cm of water.  Right carotid bruit.  Normal PMI.  Normal S1 and S2 with 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base.  No pedal edema. 


Electrocardiogram continues to show left bundle-branch block. 


Mr. Rijo has severe coronary disease and recent heart failure, with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy.  He appears to be overall stable, although he does have a few scattered rales.  He is certainly not in florid heart failure and he has no active myocardial ischemia symptoms.  The confusion over his medications is a problem with making any adjustments today, and I have asked him to return in 10 days with all of his bottles so that we can go over things once again.  I will contact Dr. Koplan about his device implantation.

RIJO, LUIS 

13375886 

01/28/2014 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Luis Rijo is a man with known coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy as well as past right parietal CVA in the year 2000.  His cardiovascular history includes bypass surgery in 1999 with a LIMA graft and 2 saphenous vein grafts and he had left main angioplasty performed in the year 2000.  He has known ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction in the 25-27% range by echocardiography and MIBI and we have recommended that he undergo a biventricular device with ICD function as he has left bundle-branch block.  He has considered this but wanted to go visit an ill sister in the Dominican Republic this winter and so he postponed device implantation.  While in the Dominican Republic 2 weeks ago, he developed acute heart failure and was admitted and his medications were changed with discontinuation of a number of medications and then institution of spironolactone as well as digoxin and furosemide. He had an echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 27 percent, consistent with his BWH studies. He spent 2 days in the Intensive Care Unit and had diuresis followed by 3 days in the hospital and he was discharged to follow up with us.  He returned from the Dominican Republic in the past couple of days and he is feeling well and he is willing to have his device implantation now.  He comes with his family and along with the Spanish translator.  We went through his records from the Dominican Republic and we also reviewed the device implantation and other plans for the future.  He is currently not short of breath and able to sleep and is interested in resolving the confusion over his Spanish and English  medications. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He appears well, weighing 147 pounds, blood pressure is 130/77, heart rate is 80 and regular.  Chest is clear to auscultation and percussion.  Jugular venous pressure is 5 cm of water, normal carotid upstrokes without bruits.  Normal PMI, no S3 gallop, normal S1 and S2 with 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex,  1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base of the heart.  No diastolic murmur is audible.  There is no pedal edema. 


His cardiogram shows left bundle-branch block with normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 with intervals of 0.15/0.18/0.43.  Axis is -80 degrees. 


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Rijo has severe coronary artery disease with ischemic cardiomyopathy and he does not have signs of active ischemia.  However, he is coming out of an episode of heart failure but currently stable.  I reviewed his medicines and at this point, I believe that we should have him on a statin for his coronary artery disease as well as aspirin (I'm not sure why this was stopped).  Even though his past left main angioplasty is a concern for risk of thrombosis, this PCI procedure was over a decade ago and I do not believe that we need to have Plavix on board currently.  As he is likely to undergoing device implantation soon, I believe that we can discontinue the Plavix.  


We will continue the digoxin and spironolactone and I am going to add back metoprolol 50 mg per day since he is clinically stable, and he tolerated higher doses before his trip abroad.  Eventually, we will want him on beta blockade as well as ARB or ACE inhibitor, and he is certainly not in acute heart failure currently.  We will check his electrolytes today and continue the Lasix.  As time progresses, we will institute an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and we will gradually escalate the beta blockade over time as well.  I will contact Dr. Bruce Koplan about having the device implantation as he is now suitable for for a BiV ICD device.  He will return to see me next week and I will be adjusting his medications frequently over the next 2-3 months.

We had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Steven Hosmer in the Cardiac Arrthymia Service in consultation for a CRT-D device . As you know, he is a very pleasant 69-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. He had a cardiac catheterization in 2005, which showed nonobstructive coronary disease. In June of 2014, he was at UMass and had a bare metal stent placed on his obtuse marginal for a 90% narrowing. Prior to that, he had been prone to have decreased LV function with ejection fraction between 25% and 30%. This was felt to be a mixed cardiomyopathy but has yet to improve. In 2009, he had atrial fibrillation and a left bundle branch block. He was treated to convert it to normal sinus rhythm. Again on June of 2012, had atrial fibrillation. He was started on Pradaxa for anticoagulation then switched to Xarelto due to issues with the Pradaxa.. Metoprolol was increased but issues with AF continued and he eventually was loaded with sotalol.

He does have severe dyspnea or exertion with any amount of activity but has become so sedentary that he doesnt do much to push it. He has no PND, but some orthopnea, occasioanl pedal edema, no lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness. He denies exertional angina as well

Assessment and Plan: 

Ischemic cardiomyopathy - Mr Hosmer has a likely ischemic cardiomyopathy, based on review of his long-standing CAD. It could be mixed as his EF was somewhat low during a cath in 2009 that was shown to be non-obstructive. He has never recovered to normal and another ECHO is being done on the 18th of August. He currently is at 25-30% with increased DOE during any excercise. His wife indicated increased fatigue and difficulty with most chores. He purposly tried to not do anything because of the fatigue and likley has a NYHA Stage III HF. He has a chronic LBBB with a QRS of 172ms. 

It is our recommendation that he proceed with a CRT-D device for not only primary prevention but for the issues with his HF symptoms. It is our hope that we improve some of his stamina and quality of life. He is aware of the risks including, bleeding, infection, heart attack, stroke and death. He has also been apprised of the RESPOND trial for patients undergoing CRT and he is interested. The research coordinaters will follow-up with him in this regards

He is set for 08/20/14 and should his EF on 08/18/14 come back normla then we will cancel the procedure

I confirmed the history of present illness, ROS, and past/family/social history. I also personally performed the comprehensive cardiac exam detailed above including examination of the jugular veins, auscultation of the lungs, palpation and auscultation of the heart. In addition, I examined the carotid arteries, the abdomen for masses and bruits, the femoral arteries, distal pulses, and extremities for peripheral edema, clubbing and cyanosis. I reviewed all diagnostic test reports, and determined the assessment and plan

He was treated to convert it to normal sinus rhythm. Again on June of 2012, had atrial fibrillation. He was started on Pradaxa for anticoagulation. Metoprolol was increased. He was having problems with Pradaxa and was converted to Xarelto. In June of 2014, he was at UMass and had a bare metal stent placed on his obtuse marginal for a 90% narrowing. Prior to that, he had been prone to have decreased LV function with ejection fraction between 25% and 30%. He says that he does quite well without severe dyspnea or exertion, PND, orthopnea, pedal edema, lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness. He denies exertional angina.

This is a very pleasant 69-year-old gentleman who has a history of mild coronary disease status post stenting recently, but has had decreasing LV function with ejection fraction in the 25% to 30% range. It is not clear if this is ischemic cardiomyopathy or independent cardiomyopathy. He is on a good medical regimen. Blood pressure is well controlled. There is no evidence of fluid retention. EKG shows sinus bradycardia with a left bundle branch block. So, I think that he would be accumulative for biventricular pacing. With an ejection fraction of 25% to 30%, he is also a candidate for an ICD. I will get him an appointment to see one of the electrophysiologists here. I would also like to get the echo here in our hands so that we can look at this more closely. Blood pressure is well controlled. There is no evidence of fluid retention. So, I would not change his current regimen. He does have atrial fibrillation in the past, but he is in sinus rhythm now. He is on sotalol 80 mg, which is I think reasonable for him. I have asked him if he would eliminate alcohol since that can contribute to cardiomyopathy and also to atrial fibrillation and I have also asked him to limit stimulants one cup of coffee a day and limit himself to one glass of ice tea. My plan will be to see him back here in 4 to 6 weeks. He plans to go to Europe for 2 weeks and my only concern there is if he has an episode of atrial fibrillation, but I think that is unlikely without any alcohol.

Thank you very much for referring this very pleasant gentlemen to MGH. As always, it is pleasure to be able to participate in the care of this very pleasant gentlemen.

Ischemic cardiomyopathy - Mr Hosmer has a likely ischemic cardiomyopathy, based on review of his long-standing CAD. It could be mixed as his EF was somewhat low during a cath in 2009 that was shown to be non-obstructive. He has never recovered to normal and another ECHO is being done on the 18th of August. He currently is at 25-30% with increased DOE during any excercise. His wife indicated increased fatigue and difficulty with most chores. He purposly tried to not do anything because of the fatigue and likley has a NYHA Stage III HF. He has a chronic LBBB with a QRS of 172ms. 

It is our recommendation that he proceed with a CRT-D device for not only primary prevention but for the issues with his HF symptoms. It is our hope that we improve some of his stamina and quality of life. He is aware of the risks including, bleeding, infection, heart attack, stroke and death. He has also been apprised of the RESPOND trial for patients undergoing CRT and he is interested. The research coordinaters will follow-up with him in this regards

He is set for 08/20/14 and should his EF on 08/18/14 come back normla then we will cancel the procedure

Reason for consult: ? CRT implantation 


HPI: Ms. Umanzor is a 67-year-old Spanish speaking man with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyoathy now admitted for decompensated heart failure.  He was reportedly diagnosed with his cardiomyopathy six years ago.  He was reportedly told it was due to a myocardial infarction.  No angiography was performed at that time.  He has been managed medically since then with progression of his disease.  His cardiologist (in San Salvador) has discussed ICD for primary prevention in the past, although Mr. Umanzor did not pursue this because he did not trust the medical care he was receiving.  His providers have now told him he may require heart transplantation.   


He travelled to Boston this month to visit his family.  While here, he noted progressive dyspnea and orthopnea with dry cough.  He became concerned and presented to the BWH ED.  Here, he was diagnosed with decompensated heart failure and was admitted to the B team.  He was placed on inotropes and diuresed with a lasix gtt.  TTE showed an LVEF of 15-20% with an LVIDd of 9.6cm.  He underwent left and right heart catheterization.  This showed clear coronaries with a mean PCWP of 35mmHg.  He has been undergoing continued medical optimization of his heart failure.  We were consulted for possible ICD/CRT-D. 


At present, he feels overall improved with lessened dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest tightness.

Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is massively dilated and has a globular 
appearance. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness. The visually 
estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is severely reduced at 15-20%. 
There is global hypokinesis with minor regional variation. Function is 
relatively best preserved in the lateral segments. There is evidence of 
restrictive filling with an E wave deceleration time of 150 ms.

Right Ventricle: The right ventricular size is normal. Global RV systolic 
function is low normal.
Left Atrium: There is mild left atrial enlargement.
Right Atrium: The right atrium is normal in size.
Aortic Valve: The aortic valve is tricuspid, mildly thickened and calcified. 
There is no evidence of aortic stenosis. There is no significant aortic 
regurgitation.
Mitral Valve: The mitral valve is thickened. Mitral valve closure is 
apically displaced and is consistent with tethering of the mitral apparatus, 
annular dilatation, and/or left ventricular enlargement. At least mild 
mitral regurgitation is present.
Tricuspid Valve: The tricuspid valve is mildly thickened. Mild to moderate 
tricuspid valve regurgitation is present. The tricuspid regurgitant velocity 
is 3.22 m/s, and with an assumed right atrial pressure of 10.0 mmHg, the 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is moderately elevated at 51.5 
mmHg.
Pulmonic Valve: There is no obvious pulmonic valve abnormality. There is 
trace pulmonary valve regurgitation.
Aorta: The aortic root size is normal, measuring 3.10 cm at the sinuses.
Pulmonary Artery: The pulmonary artery appears normal in size.
Venous: The inferior vena cava is normal in size.
Pericardium/Pleura: No significant pericardial effusion is seen.
Miscellaneous: These findings were discussed with the clinical team. 
CRITICAL FINDINGS were communicated by Dr. Ho to Dr. Cheng at 5pm at 
8/7/2014.

Left/right heart catheterization:  

No significant coronary disease.

Impression/Recommendations: 67yo gentleman from El Salvador with a non-ischemic, dilated cardiomyopathy and QRS>200ms here with decompensated heart failure.  He clearly meets an indication for an ICD given his depressed EF despite reported several years of medical therapy.  He also warrants CRT-D given his QRS width and heart failure symptoms.  We have asked the primary team to discuss with his cardiology whether he can receive routine follow up for his CRT-D in San Salvador and which device brands they are capable of following.  Once we have this information, we can likely move forward with device implantation.

Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy - first diagnosed 6 years ago in El Salvador. Admitted with decompensated heart failure. EF - 14-20%, QRSd 200+, NYHA II-III. Note NSVT however in the context of dobutamine infusion. Woud be a candidate for CRT-D. However complicated by the fact that he lives in El Salvador. Once issues regarding follow-up can be resolved, resolved, we can decide on device therapy.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 67-year-old Spanish-speaking visitor from El Salvador who presented to the Brigham with 1-2 days of increasing dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea. 


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient states that he first found out that he had cardiomyopathy approximately 6 years ago.  At that time, he reportedly had a heart attack, but was told that he was not a candidate for intervention or revascularization because of the advanced nature of his LV dysfunction.  The patient has been medically managed locally in San Salvador and had been told that at this point he needs advanced therapies including transplant.  The patient has family in the Boston area that he visits on an annual basis.  He was visiting them this time and became progressively dyspneic and orthopneic and presented to the Brigham ED for further evaluation and treatment.  He does also note a dry cough over the last few days.  Otherwise, he denies any fevers or chills.  He denies any abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, or early satiety.  He denies any peripheral edema.  He denies any palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.  He does not have an ICD or CRT.  The remainder of his review of systems is unremarkable. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable as above for nonischemic cardiomyopathy. 


ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies. 


SOCIAL HISTORY:  Unremarkable for any tobacco, ethanol or illicit drug use. 


MEDICATIONS:  At the time of admission included carvedilol 6.25 mg daily, spironolactone 50 mg daily, furosemide 40 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, and Candesartan 32 mg daily. 


On physical exam today, he is a well-appearing man in no acute distress.  He is afebrile with a heart rate of 90 and a blood pressure of 96/50 on dobutamine at 2 mic/kilograms per minute.  His neck examination shows JVP of about 10-12 cm of water sitting upright.  His carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits.  His lungs are clear bilaterally.  His cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2.  No S3 or S4 appreciated.  He does have a very soft 2/6 systolic murmur that is heard at the apex.  His abdominal exam is benign without hepatosplenomegaly.  His extremities reveal no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema and are warm and well perfused. 


His EKG shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 95 beats per minute with evidence of left atrial enlargement.  He has a left bundle-branch block with QRS duration of 164 milliseconds. 


He had an echocardiogram done yesterday.  This showed an LV ejection fraction of 15-20% with an end-diastolic dimension of 9.6 cm.  He has global hypokinesis.  His RV size and function is within normal limits.  He has mitral annular dilatation with what appears to be moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.  He has mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation with PA pressures that are estimated at 40 mmHg plus RA.  His IVC is normal in size. 


He had a left and right heart cath done today.  The left heart catheterization showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  The right heart catheterization showed an RA of 11, RV of 46/11 with a mean of 16, PA of 49/18 with a mean of 38 and a wedge of 35 mmHg respectively.  His mixed venous sat was 62% with a calculated cardiac output of 4.7 liters per minute and index of 2.4 L/min/m2.  His SVR was 1037, PVR was 46. 


His laboratory values revealed sodium of 136, potassium of 4.6, BUN of 49, creatinine of 1.82 and glucose of 136.  His magnesium is 2.2.  His LFTs are within normal limits.  His NT-proBNP is elevated at 2649.  His lipids are mildly abnormal with cholesterol of 206, triglycerides of 138, HDL of 49 and LDL of 129.  His TSH is 6.02 but his free T4 is 1.2.  His hemoglobin A1c 6.  His CBC shows a white count of 10,000, hematocrit of 35, and platelets of 169,000.  His INR is 1.1.  His UA is unremarkable. 


In summary, Mr. Umanzor is a 67-year-old man with a longstanding history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and an EF of 10-15% with an end-diastolic dimension, approaching 9 cm who comes in with predominantly left greater than right-sided heart failure.  He is currently on dobutamine at 2 mcg/kilogram per minute.  We will discontinue the dobutamine and recheck his numbers.  If he has an adequate cardiac output and index without dobutamine, we will discontinue the dobutamine altogether.  Otherwise, we will diurese him gently with a Lasix drip.  We will reinstate his outpatient regimen of spironolactone and candesartan, but will hold his Coreg for now.  Most importantly, given his left bundle-branch block morphology and his mitral regurgitation, he would benefit from CRT-D placement.  We will ask the EP Service to consult for this.  Imperative in this plan will be the necessity to find out that he in fact can have this serviced locally in El Salvador.  The patient is not a US resident or citizen.  Therefore, at the current time, he would not be eligible for advanced therapies and therefore we will not initiate this evaluation.

CC: shortness of breath  


HPI: Mr. Ernesto Umanzor is a 67 year old Spanish-speaking only gentleman from El Salvadaor with PMH of MI 6 years ago and CHF being medically managed who presents with 1-2 days of worsening shortness of breath. For the past two days, he has had worsening SOB associated with orthopnea and PND. He endorses non-productive cough for this same interval, and feels as though he "has water in his lungs." He states he has been taking his heart failure medications as prescribed, but does note he has been eating out and not watching his salt intake. For the past several years he has had intermittent shortness of breath/dyspnea on exertion. Two years ago, he was told that his heart was too weak for any kind of stent or CABG and that his only option was a heart transplant. He is able to walk approximately two blocks at baseline, and sleeps on 2 pillows at baseline. Currently, he is sleeping semi-upright. He denies fevers, night sweats, chest pain, light headedness, syncope, diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting, or abdominal pain. He does note some abdominal distension but does not feel his legs are any more swollen than normal. 


In the ED, VS were T 97F, BP 90/60 -> 100/86 on recheck, P 100, RR 16, O2 sat 100% RA. PE notable for crackles on bilateral lung fields, no lower extremity edema, and warm and well-perfused extremities with good pulses. 


Lab workup inclucded: a negative TnT, BNP 2600, INR 1.1, Cr 2.2 (baseline unknown), and an ECG notable for NSR w/ LBBB and TWI (no priors for comparison). Bedside TTE estimated EF @ 10%. He was treated with Lasix 40mg IV x1 and admitted for further management.

Hospital Course  

#Decompensated Heart Failure 

- CXR felt to be more consistent with fluid overload than pneumonia, and thus, antibiotics withheld especially in the setting of no fever and no leukocytosis 

- diuresed with Lasix 40mg IV in ER with UOP ~600cc over the next 8 hours 

- BP noted to be 80-90/60s and creatinine 2.12 (baseline unknown) with concern for poor cardiac index and systemic perfusion, thus heart failure regimen held (including coreg, candesartan, and spironolactone) 

- Lasix 80mg IV given with pressures failling to 70/doppler but without change in mental status 

- peripheral dopamine started on floor (uptitrated from 5->7.5mg/hr) overnight due to concern over cooler extremities; maintained normal mentation 

- blood pressures improved to 90s/60s on dopamine, HR increased to 90s/100s with overnight UOP ~800mL 

- in AM, started on Lasix drip with bolus 80mg IV at 10/mg/hr drip 

- sent for RHC/LHC notable for non-obstructive CAD and PCWP 35 mmHg 


# AKI 

- baseline Cr unknown, elevated on admission as above; UA unremarkable 

- differential includes renal vascular congestion vs. decreased renal perfusion due to poor forward flow 

- Cr 2.12->1.75->1.82 with diuresis and dopamine infusion 

- contrast was given during the LHC due to benefits of evaluating coronaries over risk of worsening kidney function 


# Non-Obstructive CAD 

- per patient, history of myocardial infarction, although in the setting of non-obstructive CAD, this highly unlikely 

- HgbA1C 6.0 and lipid panel CHOL 206,  TRIG 138,  LDL 129 

- started on atorvastatin 80mg PO QD and continued ASA 81mg PO QD. 


# Social Work
- visiting from El Salvador; typically spends 1 month out of the year in Boston with family 

- over the last 6 years, this has become less frequent due to his heart condition 

- family wondering how they will pay for this and would like to speak with social work/case management

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath. 


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old Spanish-speaking male visiting from El Salvador who presents with 1-2 days of increasing dyspnea on exertion.   


He has a past medical history significant for reported myocardial infarction 6 years ago with no known intervention performed and heart failure with unknown ejection fraction.  The patient reports that over the past 1-2 days, he has noticed increasing shortness of breath with exertion.  He also reports increasing orthopnea and PND.  He reports that he usually sleeps with 2 pillows but now he has basically been sleeping upright because of shortness of breath with lying flat.  He endorses no lower extremity edema or anorexia.  He denies any chest pain.  He does endorse a dry cough, which has been present for the past couple of days since he has been having shortness of breath.  He feels that his cough is secondary to water in his lungs.  He denies any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain.  The patient reports that he is compliant with all of his medications.  He has been eating out at restaurants a lot the past couple of days.  Because of the shortness of breath, the patient presented to the Brigham and Women's Hospital Emergency Department.   


His vital signs on admission:  Temperature 97, blood pressure 90/60, pulse 100, respiratory rate 16, 100% on room air.   


Initial labs were notable for a BUN of 42, creatinine of 2.12, NT-BNP 2649, negative troponin, normal white blood cell count.  In the ED, the patient had a chest x-ray, which showed mild interstitial pulmonary edema with mild cardiomegaly.  There was also a possible opacity in the right lower lobe and right middle lobe concerning for pneumonia.   


In the ED, the patient received 40 mg of IV Lasix with reported improvement in shortness of breath.   


MEDICATIONS:  Carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. daily, spironolactone 50 mg p.o. daily, furosemide 40 mg p.o. bid, aspirin 81 mg a day, candesartan 32 mg p.o. daily. 


ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 


FAMILY HISTORY:  He has a father with heart failure who is still alive at the age of 80.  No other family history of heart disease. 


SOCIAL HISTORY:  He denies alcohol, tobacco or illicit drug use.   


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital Signs:  Temperature 96.5, heart rate 90, blood pressure 92/52.  Oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.  General:  He is an obese male lying in bed in no acute distress.  He is not using accessory muscles of respiration.  Jugular venous distention elevated at greater than 15 mmHg.  Heart:  distant heart sounds, regular, no appreciable murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs:  He has crackles 2/3 up the lung fields bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities: warm with no lower extremity edema. 


LABORATORIES:  Sodium 134, potassium 4.5, chloride 100, bicarb 22, BUN 42, creatinine 2.12.  Normal liver function tests.  NT-BNP 2,649.  Troponin negative.  HDL 49.  LDL 129.  TSH 6.02.  HgA1c pending.  White blood cell count 7.93.  Hematocrit 36.6.  Platelets 107.  Normal differential.  INR 1.1.   


Electrocardiography:  Sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block, QRS 200ms 


CXR: Right lower lobe and right middle lobe pneumonia with an associated parapneumonic effusion.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly.   


Echocardiogram:  08/07/14.  Massively dilated left ventricle.  Normal left ventricular wall thickness.  EF 15-20% global hypokinesis with minor regional variation.  Mild left atrial enlargement.  RV systolic function is low normal.  Normal right atrium.  Mild mitral regurgitation.  Estimated pulmonary systolic pressure 51.5 mmHg.  No significant pericardial effusion.  EKG sinus rhythm left bundle branch block.  QRS duration 200 milliseconds.   


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 

 A 67-year-old male with a past medical history of cardiomyopathy EF 15-20% who presents with shortness of breath.  I suspect that the patient's current symptoms are secondary to heart failure from dietary noncompliance.  On physical examination, the patient appears warm, though his creatinine is elevated (unknown baseline), raising concern for possible cardiogenic shock.  Given the concern for possible cardiogenic shock, we will hold the patient's beta blocker.  Given the patient's elevated creatinine with an unknown baseline, we will also hold his ARB and spironolactone.  Given the patient's reduced ejection fraction, left bundle branch block and wide QRS, he could potentially benefit from a CRT-D, but it is unclear whether the patent is a candidate for this at this time.  Given the patient's history of reported ischemic cardiomyopathy, we will also start him on a statin.  Pneumonia seems less likely based on the patient's presentation so we will hold antibiotics at this time.

PGY-1 Addendum 


Agree with the above excellent MS4 Lawlow note with the following comments: 


In brief, Mr. Ernesto Umanzor is a 67 year old Hispanic gentleman with past medical history of CHF secondary to an MI that occurred 6 years old that has been medically managed; he is currently visiting from El Salvador and will return in a month. He is on a robust regimen, composed of furosemide 40mg PO BID, carvedilol 6.25mg PO QD, spironolactone 50mg PO QD, candesartan 32mg PO QD, and aspirin 81mg PO QD. He is being evaluated in El Salvador for a heart transplant and has been told his heart is too weak for an ICD. He presents today to BWH for shortness of breath. He also notes dyspnea with exertion (limited to walking 2 blocks prior to having to stop to catch his breath) and orthopnea to the point where he sleeps sitting up now (used to sleep on 2 pillows). He also has had a dry cough recently that only occurs when he is usually volume overloaded. He endorses eating out a lot more frequently but ascribes to full complicance with his medication. ECG at baseline has a LBBB. 


Pertinent Physical Exam 

General: resting comfortably with 2 pillows angled at 30 degrees, able to talk in full sentences 

HEENT: moist mucus membranes 

Neck: elevated JVP to the point of the mandible 

Chest: very distant heart sounds, unable to appreciate any murmurs, rubs, or gallops; normal S1 an S2 heard 

Lungs: crackles up to 2/3 the lungs, bilaterally, worse on the left than the right; dull to percussion and with decreased air movement in the right mid- and lower lung, most prounounced at the base 

Ext: warm and well-perfused, 2+ distal pulses bilaterally; minimal to no pedal edema appreciated 


Assessment and Plan 

Mr. Ernesto Umanzor is a 67 year old Hispanic gentleman with unknwn etiology of congestive heart failure presenting with an acute exacerbation and shortness of breath who appears hypervolemic on physical exam. 


# Shortness of Breath 

- likely due to fluid overload from decompensated CHF (likely not from medication non-compliance but possibly from dietary non-complicance or infection, although afebrile and no luekocytosis) 

- aggressive diuresis with appropriate electrolyte repletion (not on scales give Cr > 2) 

- 8/7 CXR: possible patchy consolidation with fluid effusion (other differential is pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion) 

- if febrile, treat for CAP with ceftriaxone and azitrhomycin 


# Acute Exacerbation on Chronic Congestive Heart Failure 

- holding home medications of carvedilol 6.25mg PO QD, spironolactone 50mg PO QD, and candesartan 32mg PO QD in the setting of low blood pressures with a narrowed pulse pressure which could indicate a low cardiac index (hypoperfusion with cardiogenic shock) 

- continue aspirin 81mg PO daily 

- monitor strict I/Os and daily weights 


# AKI 

- unknown baseline Cr 

- likely etiology is hypoperfusion from decompensated CHF, long-standing 

- will try and get records from El Salvador to evaluate for CKD 

- monitor strict I/Os              


# Social Work 

- case management to work with family regarding insurance 


# Bundle 

- Access: PIV 

- Diet: House with 2g Na restriction, 2L fluid restriction, low fat, and low cholesterol 

- FEN: not on K and Mg scales given Cr; glucose monitoring with daily BMP 

- DVT PPx: heparin 5000U SC TID 

- GI PPx: none indicated

Patient was recently hospitalizated at MGH after an episode of LOC in mid July 2012. ICD interrogation at the time showed no VT with only occasional 5-10 beat runs of NSVT on telemetry while hospitalized, not causing any symptoms. His syncope at the time was presumed to be neurocardiogenic 2/2 EtOH and dehydration. Other interventions at this hospitalization included initiation of Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia and an adenosine MIBI stress test which showed spetal and anterobasal infarction without ischemia with as EF of 26%. He was also diuresed due to fluid overload and evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR. 


Today, he presents after an attempt to upgrade his ICD device to a biventricular ICD for cardiac synchronization. His LV lead was not placed secondary to scar tissue and was subsequently removed. There were no other procedure complications.

History of present illness:
Joseph Marotta is a 66-year-old man with coronary artery disease, (CABGx3 1995, MI 2006) previous ventricular tachycardia (AICD 2010), ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 26%, T2DM, HLD and COPD who was admitted on 7/14 after two episodes of syncope. Interrogation of his AICD showed no VT and he had no sustained VT during the next three days. His syncope was ultimately attributed to dehydration due to sun exposure and alcohol use. He ruled out for MI; an adenosine MIBI diagnosed septal and anterobasal infarction without ischemia. He was fluid-overloaded and improved with diuresis. He was discharged on 7/18 with a plan for pacer upgrade on a semi-elective basis. On 7/31 an attempt was made to upgrade his biventricular pacer but this was unsuccessful due to noncapture of his LV lead. Pt will now have a left thoracotomy and epicardial wire placement.

 IMAGING PROTOCOL Imaging Agent: Tc-99m sestamibi
 According to standard departmental protocol, the patient was
 injected with 10.87 mCi of Tc-99m sestamibi at rest and ungated
 SPECT myocardial images were obtained. Subsequently, a
 pharmacological stress test was performed with IV regadenoson
 (bolus injection, 400 mcg over 10 to 20 seconds followed by 5 ml
 flush) after which 32.79 mCi of Tc-99m sestamibi was injected IV 
 10 to 20 sec later. After 30 to 60 minutes, gated SPECT images
 were obtained and assessed for myocardial perfusion and LV
 function.

MITRAL VALVE 
There is reduced mitral leaflet excursion c/w decreased cardiac output. There
is no evidence of mitral valve prolapse. There is incomplete closure of the
mitral valve leaflets c/w papillary muscle displacement. There is moderate
mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler.

LEFT ATRIUM 
The left atrium is dilated. The antero-posterior left atrial dimension is 45
mm (normal range: up to 38 mm). The medial-lateral left atrial dimension is 51
mm (normal range: up to 49 mm). The superior-inferior left atrial dimension is
62 mm (normal range: up to 53 mm).

AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT 
There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis. The aortic valve is
tricuspid. There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral
Doppler. The ascending aorta is dilated. The aortic diameter at the sinuses
of Valsalva is 36 mm (normal: less than 40mm). The ascending aorta diameter
above the sinotubular junction is 40 mm (normal: less than or equal to 36mm).

LEFT VENTRICLE 
The left ventricular end diastolic dimension when indexed for height is dilated
(greater than 95th percentile). The left ventricular systolic function is
severely impaired. The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic. The estimated
ejection fraction is 20 %. LVEF was measured by the biplane method of discs.

TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC 
There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of mild tricuspid insufficiency. 
There are pacemaker wires noted in the right heart.

PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A. 
There is evidence of mild pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral
Doppler. The RV systolic pressure was estimated from the regurgitant tricuspid
velocity (assuming an RA pressure of 10mmHg). The estimated RV systolic
pressure is 48 mmHg.

RIGHT VENTRICLE 
The right ventricle is not dilated. The right ventricular systolic function is
within normal limits.

PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES 
There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.

Diagnostic Conclusions/Overall Summary: Coronary angiography revealed native 
 three-vessel disease in a bypassed right-dominant system with a ramus 
 intermedius branch:

- the left main has no angiographically significant stenosis

- the left anterior descending artery has diffuse 90-95% proximal/mid 
 stenosis with total occlusion of the mid-LAD

- the left circumflex artery has proximal 30% stenosis and very distal 90% 
 focal stenosis in the terminal AV groove portion of the LCX

- OM1 and OM2 are diminutive vessels with diffuse severe stenosis

- the right coronary artery has diffuse proximal 40-50% stenosis, mid-vessel 
 70-80% stenosis and is totally occluded distally

Graft angiography revealed:

- patent SVG to LAD with diffuse distal LAD disease (moderate 40-50%)

- patent SVG to OM3

- patent SVG to right PDA

Abdominal aortography revealed:

- grossly patent celiac axis, SMA, and IMA

- two renal arteries on the right, both of which are grossly patent, and 
 rapidly fill the right nephrogram

- single renal artery on the left with complex 65-70% stenosis proximally, 
 just before a bifurcation of the renal artery; the nephrogram appears smaller 
 than on the right, and fills less rapidly

- moderate infrarenal aortic plaque without flow-limiting stenosis

Procedures/Equipment: Coronary Angiogram no Left Heart Cath

Abdominal Aortogram

Angiography, renal, unilateral, selective, radiological supervision and 
 interpretation

Bypass Graft Angiography

Arterial catheter placement, each first order abdominal, pelvic or lower 
 extremity artery

Findings:
Dominance: Right

Left Main: Left main coronary artery is normal.

LAD: The Proximal LAD has a focal 95 % stenosis after the takeoff of first 
 diagonal branch. The Mid LAD is totally occluded.

Left Circumflex: The Proximal Circumflex has a long 30 % stenosis in its mid 
 third. The Distal Circumflex is has a 90% stenosis in its terminal portion. 
 The 1st and 2nd Marginal branches are diffusely diseased.

RCA: The Proximal RCA has a diffuse 45 % stenosis in its mid third. The Mid 
 RCA has a focal 85 % stenosis involving the takeoff of first acute marginal 
 branch. The Distal RCA is totally occluded.

Grafts: The Saphenous vein graft to Distal LAD is patent. The Saphenous vein 
 graft to 3rd Marginal is patent. The Saphenous vein graft to Right PDA is 
 patent.

Anesthesia Assessment And Plan:
ASA Class 4 patient with failure to upgrade AICD due to non-capture of LV lead and is scheduled for an Epicardial Lead placement. 

THE PATIENT HAD SEVERAL CONCERNS FOR SURGERY:
- PT WANTS SEDATION THROUGH IV PRIOR TO A-LINE PLACEMENT AND PRIOR TO ENTERING OR
- PT WISHES URINARY CATHETER TO BE REMOVED IN OR IF POSSIBLE, PT IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT RETENTION
- PT WANTS HIS BLOOD SUGAR MONITORED OFTEN WHILE NPO DUE TO 2 PRIOR EVENTS OF HYPOGLYCEMIA WHILE WAITING FOR SURGERY

The anesthesia consent form was thoroughly reviewed with the patient and his/her questions and concerns regarding general anesthesia were answered. 

Anesthetic Approach: GA
Monitoring: Standard ASA monitors (NIBP, ECG, SaO2, Temp), A-line, +/- Central Line, TEE 
IV Access: LBPIV
Patient Instructions: NPO after midnight.

Final plan will be determined on day of surgery by anesthesia team.

Requesting cardiologist: Theofanie Mela, MD 

Attending Surgeon: Jennifer Walker, MD 


Reason for consult: Epicardial lead placement 

HPI:  Joseph Marotta is a 66-year-old man with coronary artery disease, (CABGx3 1995, MI 2006) previous ventricular tachycardia (AICD 2010) and ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted on 7/14 after two episodes of syncope. Interrogation of his AICD showed no VT and he had no sustained VT during the next three days. His syncope was ultimately attributed to dehydration due to sun exposure and alcohol use.  He rule out for MI; an adenosine MIBI diagnosed septal and anterobasal infarction without ischemia. He was fluid-overloaded and improved with diuresis. He was discharged on 7/18 with a plan for pacer upgrade on a semi-elective basis. On 7/31 an attempt was made to upgrade his biventricular pacer but this was unsuccessful due to noncapture of his LV lead. The cardiac surgery service is now consulted for left thoracotomy and epicardial wire placement. At present he is anxious but feels well.

Assessment: 66-year-old man with CAD, CHF, DM, COPD and need for AICD/pacemaker placement, not able to be done with transvenous wires. He will need a preoperative workup including labs and PA/lateral CXR, all of which are pending. Provided that these are okay then we will proceed with left thoracotomy and epicardial lead placement tomorrow. The patient wishes to proceed and consents to the operation. 


Plan: Please obtain PA/lateral CXR, CBC, chemistries, LFTs, coagulation studies, blood bank sample. Please keep NPO. Thank you for allowing us to assist in the care of this interesting patient. This plan was discussed with Dr Walker.

He was outside all day at Revere beach, then went to a bar and had 5 drinks (2 beers, 2 shots, 1 mixed drink) and had 2 episodes of sudden LOC without prodrome, with body jerks. Device was interrogated by EP. Syncope likely occurred in the setting of heavy EtOH use, with measured level of 922. Suspect that syncope is neurocardiogenic syncope related to EtOH.  Pt also had stress test this morning to r/o ischemia, now awaiting final results before being discharged home. 

              In terms of his diabetes control, since admission he was placed on NPH BID alone (converted NPH dose from pre-mix doses of 75/25 at home).

Assessment/Recommendations:  

66 yo male with suboptimal DM control prior to admission with A1c 9.1% and rare hypoglycemia at home now admitted for LOC. 

Hypoglycemia in hospital setting is likely due to his decrease in PO intake since kidney functions are within normal baseline.  I suspect that he often forgets to take his insulin and also eat alot more than reported since he has rare low BS at home and A1c is high. 

He can benefit from improved DM control as outpatient which f/u appt has been scheduled. 

Can discharge back on 75/25:  62 units BID. 

Reviewed discharge instruction with pt. 

Thank you for this consult.  The Diabetes Inpatient Service will follow this patient while in hospital.   


120 minutes spent with patient, >50% of time spent with pt face to face and coordinating patient care. 

Start time 1430, end time 1630.

Mr. Marotta, 

We wanted to make you aware of the following lab results that were performed during your admission: 


HbA1c (average blood sugar over 3 months): 9.1% 

Your Goal: Generally less than 7% 

You had low blood sugar during hospital stay because you have been eating less in hospital.  With your report of rare low blood sugar at home, we would like you to resume your home doses of insulin at time of discharge.  We are discharging you on the following insulin regimen for your diabetes: 


Before Breakfast: and Before Supper: 

Humalog 75/25:  62 units 

  Please check your blood sugars before meals and at bedtime.  Goal is to have blood sugars before meals usually in the 80-120 range and at bedtime in the 110-150 range. These goals may be adjusted by your physician. If you have questions before you are able to see your endocrinologist, please contact us by calling the pager system at 617.726.2066 and paging #20737 or  #14364 ( for urgent matters).  If you have any blood sugars less than 70, drink a small glass of juice or regular soda, and please contact us at the number listed above. 


You have a scheduled follow up appointment at the MGH Outpatient Diabetes Clinic on Monday 7/30/12 at 2:30pm with Janet Whitley NP.  If you cannot come to your appointment for any reason, please call us as soon as you know at the number listed below.  Please remember to bring your glucometer and blood sugar readings logs to your appointment.

Patient was seen by Tobacco Treatment Service counselor today. He reports smoking 40-60 cig/day X 53 years.  Last use: 3 days ago. Pt is on a 21 mg patch, endorses severe cravings.  Recommend increase patch dose to 42 mg and add 10 mg nic inhaler plus 2 mg mini lozenge. Pt says "I've gotta quit" but he's not sure he can. He is highly addicted. Recommend he stay on combination NRT upon discharge and that he consult with his PCP about adding bupropion if the NRT alone is not effective. Please write scripts for  42 mg patch + 4 mg nic lozenge so MassHealth will cover! The inhaler will need  Prior Authorization from his PCP. See full note in inpatient chart.

Comments: F/u today with patient for DM diet education. Briefly reviewed DM diet. During interview pt vocalized good knowledge of recommendations for CHO moderation/portion control. Admitted s/p 2 episodes of witnessed syncope without AICD firing after being on the beach all day. Admits to drinking 4 beers, 1 glass of wine and 2 tequila shots that day. Has previously discussed EtOH consumption with his PCP who asked pt to limit himself to 1 drink per day maximum. Previously unaware of impact EtOH has on BG. Per pt he has new dx of CHF and was told he was retaining fluid around his heart. Given main barrier to compliance with DM diet is discipline vs. knowledge deficit, shifted focus of education to discuss low sodium diet. Explained role of sodium in fluid retention and discussed tips for reducing sodium in the diet such as not adding Na while cooking or at the table, discouraged dining at fast food restaurants, and decreasing intake of processed/packaged foods. Provided list of low sodium snacks for pt to trial (snack pair CHO + pro for optimal BG control also). Provided Cheese comparison and reinforced appropriate portion sizes. Pt reports he is "addicted to potato chips" and seems unable to control himself when they are nearby. States he gives in to these cravings almost daily. He is aware that this snack food negatively impacts his BG and contains a high amount of salt/fat. When pt asked which dietary changes he wanted to work on first, he replied, "no drinking, no smoking, no salt." RD phone and e-mail contact info provided. Pt aware RD available prn.

Date/Time of Encounter:07/14/12 21:21 [ck35]

Information Source:Medical records and electronic records reviewed. [ck35]

        History of Present Illness:
HPI:Patient is a 66-year-old man who presented after a syncopal event. He was at the bar, after having about 6 drinks with his friends. He then suddenly lost consciousness. She did not have a prodrome prior to this event. He was brought to the ED by EMS. Shortly after arrival in the ED, he had another event where he lost consciousness. He did not call this event either. He had no chest pain or palpitations. He has no chest pain now. He regained consciousness spontaneously after several seconds. His AICD did not fire. He did not a postictal state. He has no focal neurologic weakness, numbness number tingling. He has not been recently ill. He has been drinking alcohol, and smoking, but denies any other drug use. [ck35]

        Physical Exam:
General:Vitals as per nursing notes. Patient is awake and alert currently, but did have a period of unresponsiveness and hypoxia it was witnessed by nursing in the ED. [ck35]
Head/Eyes:The head is normocephalic and atraumatic. [ck35]
ENT:The mucous membranes are moist. [ck35]
Neck:The neck is supple. [ck35]
Chest/Respiratory:The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. [ck35]
Cardiovascular:The heart sounds have a normal S1/S2. [ck35]
GI/Abdomen:The abdomen is nontender and nondistended. Abdomen is soft. [ck35]
Musculoskeletal:1+ bilateral lower extremity edema which the patient states is baseline. [ck35]
Skin:The patients skin is intact. [ck35]
Neurologic:The neurological exam shows no focal deficits. Motor function is intact. Peripheral sensation is intact. Speech fluent. [ck35]

        Differential Diagnosis and Plan:
Differential Diag/Plan:Patient is a 66-year-old man who presents after an episode of loss of consciousness and the bar, and another episode of loss of consciousness here. Patient spontaneously recovered. It appeared that he had a wide-complex tachycardia on the rhythm, however on later review with electrophysiology this was felt to be his pacer. He did not have chest pain or palpitations, but I do suspect that he had a malignant dysrhythmia. According to the electrophysiology fellow, he could have had ventricular tachycardia, but his AICD would not recorded this unless it was greater than 200. However, there is no dysrhythmia caught on our monitor, even during his event. He did not have a postictal state, so I do not think this is a seizure. We have ordered labs including cardiac markers. We are starting him on amiodarone, IV, as well as an amiodarone drip. We have ordered a head CT. We will keep on a monitor and we have applied Zoll pads. Patient will be admitted to the ICU or step down unit for continued cardiac monitoring. [ck35]

Diagnosis:syncope, [ck35]

Critical Care Minutes:45 [ck35]

Critical Care Services:The patient experienced a potentially life-threatening tachydysrhythmia. The patient received continual bedside reassessment of any signs or symptoms of active coronary ischemia, including chest discomfort or any anginal equivalent, and of circulatory function including hemodynamics and indicators of end-organ perfusion. The risks and benefits of nodal blocking agents and antiarrhythmic agents were considered prior to selection and administration of medication. The risks versus benefits of electrical cardioversion were continually re-evaluated. [ck35]

Resident Documentation Review Comment:I have personally seen and examined the patient and reviewed the residents findings and plan. As necessary, I have inserted my suggestions, comments or clarifications to the residents findings and plan in the note above. [ck35]

Last cardiac cath: 1/2008:  

Coronary angiography revealed native 
three-vessel disease in a bypassed right-dominant system with a ramus 
intermedius branch:
- the left main has no angiographically significant stenosis
- the left anterior descending artery has diffuse 90-95% proximal/mid 
stenosis with total occlusion of the mid-LAD
- the left circumflex artery has proximal 30% stenosis and very distal 90% 
focal stenosis in the terminal AV groove portion of the LCX
- OM1 and OM2 are diminutive vessels with diffuse severe stenosis
- the right coronary artery has diffuse proximal 40-50% stenosis, mid-vessel 
70-80% stenosis and is totally occluded distally

Graft angiography revealed:
- patent SVG to LAD with diffuse distal LAD disease (moderate 40-50%)
- patent SVG to OM3
- patent SVG to right PDA

AdenoMIBI: 1/2008 

The ECG is negative for ischemia.  The sensitivity of
       adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting CAD is limited.
       PT had baseline chest pressure that increased slightly with
       exercise.
       The perfusion images show an incomplete anteroseptal scar
       associated with mild peri-infarct ischemia.  There is also a small
       zone of inferoapical ischemia.  These findings are new since the
       previous study of 03 Jan 2005 and the LVEF has declined from 65%
       to 48% in the interval.

Assessment/Plan 

66M with h/o CAD s/p 4vessel CABG 1995, h/o MI 2006, AICD placement 2010, EF 20% per pt report, HTN, DM, HL presenting with 2 episodes of witnessed syncope without AICD firing. 


#Syncope: Now s/p 3 episodes of witnessed, unheralded LOC.  He did have body jerks during these episodes which seem more consistent with myoclonic jerks associated with syncope rather than seizure activity given rapid recovery and no postictal state. No events on telemetry in the ED during witnessed episode.  Device was interrogated by EP without any recorded VT or AICD firing; however, his rate is set at 200 and VT of lower rate may not have been recorded. Head CT in ED negative for acute process. Syncope occurred in the setting of heavy EtOH use, with measured level of 922. Suspect that syncope is neurocardiogenic syncope related to EtOH. He is high risk for ventricular arrhythmias and should be monitored, but given no events on tele and no events on interrogation, doubt that a ventricular arrhythmia is the cause of his symtpoms. Cardiac ischemia is also in the differential. He denies any chest pain (but has diabetes) and has initial negative troponin. 

- monitor on telemetry 

- d/c amiodarone drip 

- second troponin in 8 hours 

- encourage abstinence from EtOH 

- Q4H neuro checks  

- Touch base with EP regarding increasing backup rate of PPM to 65 to help with ?neurocardiogenic syncope 


#CV-Rhythm: As above, unheralded syncope is suspicious for dysrhythmia.  No dysrhythmia seen on telemetry in ED during syncopal episode. Ectopy on monitor here and EKGs.  

- monitor as above 

- K>4, Mg>2 


#CV-ischemia: Last cath 2008 with patent grafts. Trop negative, no chest pain. 

- recheck trop as above 

- continue home ASA, crestor 

- lipid panel 

- AdenoMIBI pre-discharge 


#CV-pump: Last EF 48% in 2008, per pt 20% more recently. Clinically hypervolemic on exam.  S/P 40IV Lasix in ED.   

- Preload: BPs 90's-100's/50's-60's in ED. Diurese given crackles/wheezes on exam, elevated JVP, LE edema.  

- Continue metoprolol 25mg Q6H. 

- Hold Lisinopril, Isordil given low BP and syncope. Will restart lisinopril as BP tolerates and d/c isordil to start Aldactone. 

- Fish oil TID on discharge 

- Repeat TTE here 

- obtain OSH records 

- given wide QRS on escape and symptoms, is candidate for CRT.  Discuss with outpatient cardiologist. Potentially referal to CRT clinic on discharge. 


#Anion gap metabolic acidosis: AG of 15, CO219.5.  Suspect EtOH related ketoacidosis. No history of toxic alcohol ingestions, no renal failure, glucose 256 in DM2 unlikely to represent DKA, no infectious symtoms or signs or e/o hypoperfusion to suggest lactic acidosis. 

- repeat chem 7 in AM 


#DM: Lispro sliding scale 

-HbA1c 


#COPD: continue home albuterol and spirive 

-encourage smoking cessation 

-nicotine patch while in house 


#EtOH use:  

- monitor for signs of withdrawl and treat prn with benzos

CCU Intern Admit Note 


Name: WILSON,HOPE 

MRN: 29969615(BWH) 

DOB: 11/17/60 

PCP: BRENDA GEDDIS-COMRIE 

Attending: Dr Sabatine 

Date of Admission: 01/12/2015 


Chief Complaint: 

Hypotension s/p procedure 


HPI 

54yo F w/ idiopathic NICM (EF 15-20%) s/p PPM and ICD (2011) who presented with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea and chest pain to OSH and was transferred to BWH for CHB and is now admitted to the CCU for post-procedureal hypotension c/f cardiogenic shock.  


Pt was diagnosed with NICM in 2011 after presenting with AV block, at which time (per report) LHC was w/o CAD; she had a cardiac MRI at the time w/ ?sarcoid, but no PET or biopsy were performed. She had been doing well until 6 months before presentation, when she was hospitalized for IV diuresis after having decreased exercise tolerance and began to have episodes of chest tightness and weakness over the past 6 weeks. Two days prior to admission, she began having more frequent intense episodes of chest tightness, dyspnea and weakness with worsening orthopnea and PND. She tried taking extra doses of Lasix at home without relief and so presented to OSH ED. At the OSH ED, she wsa found to be in CHB w/ HRs in the 40s, at which point her PPM backup rate was increased to 60 (w/ some improvement in symptoms). She has not been on ACE inhibitors or beta blocker because of marked hypotension in the past on these medications.  


She had recently seen Dr Epstein at BWH and he determined that she needed replacement of both atrial and ventricular leads and recommending upgrading to a BiV device (due to high V-pacing demand). She was transferred to BWH for further evaluation. 


ED COURSE: 

On arrival, she afebrile, with a HR of 68, BP 98/61, RR 16 and satting 98% on RA. She was noted have RBBB/LAFB with V pacing at 60. 


OPERATIVE COURSE: 

Pt was taken for atrial and ventricular lead extraction. The initial venous access was difficult to obtain. On induction (with etomidate), pt became hypotensive to the 60/40s and was started on epinephrine, phenylephrine. She was then transitioned to norepinephrine and epinephrine, and the phenylephrine was stopped. Dobutamine was then added as she was felt to be in cardiogenic shock. After dobutamine was added, she was noted to have much ectopy and was started on a lidocaine gtt.  


After the procedure, when awakening, pt coughed blood into the ETT. She was then reinduced and an anesthesia bronchoscopy showed no upper airway source of bleeding and no mucosal damage. A bedside TTE was performed and showed no signs of tamponade. A CXR showed a ?small L pneumothorax (that subsequent imaging felt was artifactual). Thoracic surgery was consulted a L chest tube was placed. Throughout the procedure, she received 1 L NS and 1500cc of obligate ins. She was given Lasix IV 20 mg and put out 500-600 cc to this.  


On arrival to the CCU, she was on Levophed 8, Epi 15, Dobutamine 5 and Lidocaine 1. Her only complaint was of chest tube pain and ICD pocket pain.

   A14259351:  FDG PET Myocardial Viability
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REPORT:
     Dear Dr. Lakdawala,

     Your patient Hope Wilson, a 54 year old female with a history of
     non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease, was
     referred to us for a rest-only PET study to evaluate for cardiac
     sarcoidosis.

     
     Rest Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT/CT and F-18 FDG PET/CT Protocol:

     Ms. Wilson underwent a myocardial perfusion SPECT/CT study
     following the IV administration of 14 mCi of Tc-99m Sestamibi at
     rest. Gated myocardial perfusion SPECT images were obtained at
     rest.  A limited CT scan of the chest was obtained solely for the
     purpose of attenuation correction and is not meant to serve as a
     diagnostic study.

     Following perfusion imaging, the patient was injected with 12.8 mCi
     of F-18 FDG. After a 90-minute uptake period, a dedicated cardiac
     PET/CT was obtained. Finally, a limited whole body FDG PET/CT scan
     was obtained.  She was instructed to follow a high fat, low
     carbohydrate diet prior to the study.

     
     Rest Myocardial Perfusion and FDG Images:

     Image quality was excellent.  The images demonstrated severe LV
     dilatation and normal tracer uptake in the lungs.  They also
     demonstrated normal RV size and tracer uptake.  The rest perfusion
     images demonstrated no evidence of regional perfusion
     abnormalities. FDG images showed moderate diffuse FDG uptake
     throughout the LV.

     
     Gated SPECT:

     The rest LV ejection fraction was 19% with severely enlarged LV
     volumes (ESVI: 159 ml/m2).  There was severe global hypokinesis.
     The RV function appeared normal.

     
     Limited Whole Body FDG PET/CT Images:

     The whole body PET/CT images were reviewed by Dr. Hyewon Hyun.

     Images were obtained from the level of the basal ganglia to the
     kidneys.

     COMPARISON: None

     HEAD AND NECK: There is no FDG-avid disease or significant
     lymphadenopathy in the imaged portions of the head and the neck.

     CHEST: There is diffuse mild FDG avidity in the esophagus. There is
     no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. There is no
     pleural or pericardial effusion. There is no air-space disease or
     suspicious lung nodule. Pacemaker is present.

     ABDOMEN/PELVIS: There is no significant lymphadenopathy and no
     FDG-avid disease in the upper abdomen. Post cholecystectomy.

     MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no FDG-avid or destructive bone lesion.

     

     Final impression:

     1.  No definitive evidence of active cardiac inflammation. FDG
     uptake is diffuse and non-specific.

     2.  LV function was severely reduced.

     3.   There is no definite evidence of intrapulmonary sarcoidosis.

     4.   Diffuse mild FDG avidity in the esophagus. Correlate for signs
     and symptoms of esophagitis.

     

     These findings were communicated by Dr. Marcelo Di Carli to Dr.
     Neal K Lakdawala at 04:00 PM on Friday, January 9, 2015.

     Thank you for referring this patient to us.

Diagnosis: CP w/Abn ECG

Location: Inpatient, L2 Lab.

Study Quality: The images were of adequate diagnostic quality.

Study Details:Complete Echo (2D, Color, Doppler) - 93306. The patient was 
awake.

2D:    Measurements:

IVS, d 0.4 cm        RWT            0.2
LV, d  7.7 cm        LV Mass (AL)   222 g
LV, s  7.0 cm        LV Mass (BSA)  115 g/m2
LVPW   0.8 cm        Aortic Root, d 2.6 cm
LA, s  5.5 cm

Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is severely dilated. The visually 
estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is severely reduced at 15-20%. 
There is global hypokinesis with minor regional variation. Abnormal 
(paradoxical) motion is consistent with RV pacemaker function. No left 
ventricular thrombus is detected.

Right Ventricle: The right ventricular size is moderately enlarged. Global 
RV systolic function is mildly reduced. A pacemaker or AICD wires are seen 
in the right heart.
Left Atrium: There is severe left atrial enlargement.
Right Atrium: The right atrium is mildly dilated.
Aortic Valve: The aortic valve is trileaflet and mildly thickened. There is 
no evidence of aortic stenosis. There is trace aortic valve regurgitation.
Mitral Valve: The mitral valve is mildly diffusely thickened and there is 
apical displacement of the mitral valve closure pattern consistent with 
mitral valve tethering and/or a dilated left ventricle. Mitral valve closure 
is apically displaced and is consistent with tethering of the mitral 
apparatus, annular dilatation, and/or left ventricular enlargement. Severe 
mitral regurgitation is present.
Tricuspid Valve: The tricuspid valve is mildly thickened. Moderate to severe 
tricuspid valve regurgitation is present. The tricuspid regurgitant velocity 
is 3.26 m/s, and with an assumed right atrial pressure of 15.0 mmHg, the 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is moderately elevated at 57.5 
mmHg.
Pulmonic Valve: There is no obvious pulmonic valve abnormality. There is no 
pulmonic stenosis. There is trace pulmonary valve regurgitation.
Aorta: The aortic root size is normal, measuring 2.60 cm at the sinuses. The 
ascending aorta is normal, and measures 3.10 cm.
Pulmonary Artery: The pulmonary artery appears normal in size.
Venous: The inferior vena cava is normal in size.
Pericardium/Pleura: No significant pericardial effusion is seen.

Comparison /Summary: No prior BWH studies or reports for comparison.

Assessment and Plan 

54yo F w/ niCMP (EF 25-30%), h/o CHB who is now s/p ICD lead extraction and BiV upgrade who presents with hypotension and hemoptysis requiring three pressors. 


# Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock (known low EF), distributive physiology secondary to vasoplegia from anesthesia vs sepsis (though afebrile, minimal leukocytosis and no localizing symptoms) or obstructive shock (tamponade from procedure, PE). Currently on two pressors (norepi, epi) and inodilator (dobutamine) and having much ectopy. Etiology of her cardiogenic shock may be worsening of her underlying cardiomyopathy induced by the stress of anesthesia, ischemia, new valvular dysfunction or infection. On exam (on dobutamine and epinephrine), patient is warm with a good proportional pulse pressure and labs show leukocytosis with L shift, which argues against cardiogenic shock and more for distributive physiology (though may be leukemoid reaction). Less likely to be hypovolemic shock, adrenal insufficiency. 

Diagnostics 

- TTE to evaluate EF, valvular lesions and for tamponade 

- Blood cultures, urine culture, repeat CXR 

- Troponins, CK 

- Will need to obtain central access and consider PA placement  

- Would be helpful to have mixed venous / central venous sat with IJ placement 

Therapeutics 

- Will wean off epinephrine first to avoid arrhythmogenic effect  

- Dobutamine for inotropic support, but may be able to wean with time 

- Levophed for vasoconstriction and some inotropy 

- Vanc / cefepime for bacterial coverage, with possible source of pneumonia (given hemoptysis) 


# CV/p: Pt with dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology, thought possibly to be due to sarcoid, but PET w/o e/o pulm or cardiac sarcoid (though may have burned-out sarcoid). Other etiologies of DCM are possible (connective tissue, HIV, genetic, hemochromatosis, amyloid, thyrotoxicosis). Currently, patient appears wet (though difficult to interpret given severe TR) and warm while on inotropes and after receiving fluid in the cath lab.  

- May benefit from genetic testing in the future 

- Hold ACE and BB i/s/o hypotension 

- Will hold diuresis for now as patient satting well on nasal cannula and concern from sepsis 


# CV/r: Now s/p CRT-D with ventricular ectopy while on dobutamine and epinephrine.  

- Appreciate EP recs 

- Will attempt to wean off lidocaine with epinephrine 

- CTM electrolytes 


# Hemopytsis: Differential includes infection, iatrogenic, vasculitis or DAH. Upper airway bleeding less likely given results of bronchoscopy. 

- Sputum culture 

- T  S, monitor coags, trend CBC 

- Antibiotics as above 


# AKI:  

- UA, urine culture 

- CTM  


# Bundle  

FEN: NPO for possible PAC placement 

Glucose: Daily BMP 

Access: Femoral line 

Foley: Yes for UOP monitoring 

DVT: Holding s/p procedure and with hemoptysis 

GI: Not indicated 

PT/OT: Will need to consult 

Ventilated:  No

Date/Time of Visit:  1/9/2015  2:00 PM


Source/Reason for Referral:   Pt referred to SW during interdisciplinary huddle for psychosocial assessment and coping with anxiety Social History 

Living/family situation and support system:  Mrs. Wilson is a 54 year old woman who lives in Southbridge, MA. Pt is married and lives with her supportive husband who has been staying at bedside during admission. She has 5 children, all of whom live in the same town and are supportive of pt. She reports that she was independent with her ADL's prior to admission and was working full time. She is hopeful to return to this prior baseline of functioning. 


Work/educational status: Pt works in trade compliance for 3M respirator masks. Works full time, but is taking FMLA 2/2 illness. Plans to return to work when medically cleared.


Financial/Insurance issues: Pt does not endorse any financial concerns at this time. PHCS Multiplan for insurance. SW will assist in having FMLA paperwork completed by medical team while pt is admitted.


Brief history of current health status/comorbidities:  Per LMR, 54yo F w/ idiopathic NICM (EF 15-20%) s/p PPM and ICD (2011) who presented with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea and chest pain to OSH and was transferred to BWH for CHB and is now admitted to the CCU for post-procedural hypotension c/f cardiogenic shock. Please refer to medical record for complete medical hx.


Patient's/Family's understanding of illness/diagnosis:  Pt with a good understanding of her illness. She reports that the medical team is communicating well with her and she feels well informed of her plan of care. She notes "I have a history of dropping dead in my family, so I have to have some genetic testing to see if this is ischemic or not". She reports that she has excellent cardiology follow up close to home and plans to see Dr. Lakdawala in clinic at BWH for her heart failure management.


Patient's/Family's goals of care: Pt is hopeful to d/c home and eventually return to her prior active baseline of functioning. Eventually, she plans to return to working full time as this brings her much purpose. She enjoys being able to spend time with her family and is certain that they will be available to support her at home post discharge. In regard to her health, she states "this is my burden to bear, but I have to take it seriously and make the best of it". She notes that she has maintained excellent medication, diet/fluid restriction and follow up compliance. She is hopeful that she will feel less short of breath and have increased exercise tolerance at home to resume her previous qol. 


Mental health history: Pt denies a formal mental health history but does endorse anxiety around procedure at BWH. She copes by relying on her family for support and by utilizing her sense of humor. She states that being able to "name" her feelings as anxiety has significantly helped her manage it. No SI/HI, pt is future oriented.


Alcohol/tobacco/substance history: Pt previously smoked tobacco but quit in 2011. No alcohol or illicit substance use reported.


Abuse/DV history: Screening completed. None reported at this time.


Advanced Directives/HC Proxy: Pt's husband ,Michael Hayes, is HCP. Copy in chart.


Other risks and concerns:


Additional Info:  Assessment 

Narrative:  Mrs. Wilson is a lovely 54 year old woman who presents today sitting up in her chair, A+Ox3 and engaging with social work. She notes that she is feeling significantly better and is looking forward to transferring out of the ICU. She reflects on her support system and shares that some of her children have been feeling guilty about being unable to be at the hospital prior to her procedure so she has been keeping them updated via phone and assured them that she is happy to take their support at home once she is discharged. She has had many supportive visitors who have helped to keep pt's spirits up during admission. Pt reports feeling as though this  hospitalization has given her further insight into her illness and that she is appreciative of direct communication from providers. She is eager for genetic testing and seeing what that may reveal. She appears well informed and involved in her medical care. 

Patient Interventions/Education:

Chart review

Discussed pt with medical team

Educated pt around role of SW in hospital setting and provided contact information

Assessed pt's understanding of illness/plan of care

Explored pt's support system and coping mechanisms

 Plan 


Plan:

SW will continue to follow for ongoing psychosocial support through admission. Please feel free to page.

Unless otherwise noted, Pt in agreement with plan.

Electrocardiogram reveals ventricular pacing at 60 beats per minute with AV dissociation and organized atrial activity compatible with sinus bradycardia. Cardiac Echocardiogram 

1/7/14 TTE: LVEDD 7.7

Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is severely dilated. The visually 
estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is severely reduced at 15-20%. 
There is global hypokinesis with minor regional variation. Abnormal 
(paradoxical) motion is consistent with RV pacemaker function. No left 
ventricular thrombus is detected.

Right Ventricle: The right ventricular size is moderately enlarged. Global 
RV systolic function is mildly reduced. A pacemaker or AICD wires are seen 
in the right heart.
Left Atrium: There is severe left atrial enlargement.
Right Atrium: The right atrium is mildly dilated.
Aortic Valve: The aortic valve is trileaflet and mildly thickened. There is 
no evidence of aortic stenosis. There is trace aortic valve regurgitation.
Mitral Valve: The mitral valve is mildly diffusely thickened and there is 
apical displacement of the mitral valve closure pattern consistent with 
mitral valve tethering and/or a dilated left ventricle. Mitral valve closure 
is apically displaced and is consistent with tethering of the mitral 
apparatus, annular dilatation, and/or left ventricular enlargement. Severe 
mitral regurgitation is present.
Tricuspid Valve: The tricuspid valve is mildly thickened. Moderate to severe 
tricuspid valve regurgitation is present. The tricuspid regurgitant velocity 
is 3.26 m/s, and with an assumed right atrial pressure of 15.0 mmHg, the 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is moderately elevated at 57.5 
mmHg.
Pulmonic Valve: There is no obvious pulmonic valve abnormality. There is no 
pulmonic stenosis. There is trace pulmonary valve regurgitation.
Aorta: The aortic root size is normal, measuring 2.60 cm at the sinuses. The 
ascending aorta is normal, and measures 3.10 cm.
Pulmonary Artery: The pulmonary artery appears normal in size.
Venous: The inferior vena cava is normal in size.
Pericardium/Pleura: No significant pericardial effusion is seen.

54yoW presented to the ED with dyspnea and palpitations.  


Medical history includes the following 

-non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 25-30%) s/p 2c StJ ICD 9/27/11
-ventricular tachycardia, ATP responsive 

-sick sinus syndrome with bifascicular block (RBBB/LAFB) and first degree AV delay 

-diverticulosis 


Her cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 2011 and she subsequently underwent dual chamber ICD placement at Umass with a StJ 2088 atrial lead (CA4047322) and a StJ Durata 7121Q ventricular lead (BNU012286). She has been followed for noise on the atrial lead and rising threshold on her RV lead. She has been followed by Dr Paul Santoiucito at Umass for electrophysiology and recently established care with Dr Epstein in the arrhythmia center here, several days ago. During routine interrogation of her device she was noted to develop AV block when pacing in the atrium at 100bpm. Device extraction and reimplant with a CRT-D device was discussed during that visit.  


Yesterday developed frequent palpitations accompanied by a pressure-like feeling in the neck. During particularly bad episodes she also developed dyspnea and nausea. She went to Harrington Memorial Hospital in Southbridge where she was noted to be in a ventricularly paced rhythm at 40bpm. Her device was reprogrammed to set her ventricular rate at 60bpm. She was transferred here for further evaluation. Here, her ECG showed sinus rhythm with long AV delay and RBBB/LAFB pattern. Follow-up ECG showed complete heart block with ventricular pacing at 60bpm. She was admitted for further evaluation.

Her leads are malfunctioning and would benefit from revision. We discussed this with the patient who would like to undergo this procedure today. We will plan for ICD and lead extraction in the OR tomorrow morning as a first case, with reimplantation of a CRT-D device. She would likely find benefit from synchronized ventricular pacing despite lack of LBBB given her long AV delay and because of her intermittent heart block which is clearly giving her symptoms. The procedure was discussed in detail with the patient and consent obtained and filed to chart.

Dear Colleagues: 


I had the pleasure of admitting Hope Wilson to the Cardiomyopathy Service at Brigham and Women's Hospital for management of worsening heart failure. 


As you know, Hope's index presentation was in 2011 with AV block.  At that time, she was noted to have cardiomyopathy and underwent coronary angiography, which was notable for no significant coronary artery disease.  She reports a cardiac MRI was performed at that time but cannot recall the findings, that discussion was made of sarcoid, but that a biopsy was deferred and that a PET scan was unlikely to have been performed.  She had placement of a dual-chamber pacemaker defibrillator and only recently has begun experiencing heart failure symptoms.  Where she was initially on just furosemide 20 mg once daily, this has been gradually up titrated due to worsening exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She was hospitalized on one occasion for heart failure at Harrington Memorial Hospital in Southbridge in July 2014.  During that admission, she was treated with intravenous furosemide, experienced a 10 pound weight loss, and associated improvement in symptoms.  Since that time, however, her diuretic requirement has escalated and she has become progressively more symptomatic.  She had been treated in the past with an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker, however these were withdrawn due to hypotension and associated dizziness, which resolved with cessation of these medications.  She has not experienced lower extremity edema, but does endorse early satiety and is quite aware of paroxysms of tachypnea. 


Her review of systems is notable for remote history of iritis, no history of rash, arthralgias, productive cough.  There is no history of  residence or travel to Central or South America, no history of a blood transfusion.  She does not endorse symptoms of overt skeletal myopathy. 


Her past medical history is limited to the aforementioned cardiomyopathy and AV block and sick sinus syndrome.  Her ICD is as noted above, she has not had an ICD therapy, but due to potential pacemaker dysfunction, has had inactivation of her right atrial lead.  This was noted in Dr. Epstein's recent correspondence, when he noted that replacement is required for both atrial and ventricular leads and contemplated implantation of a resynchronization device given that RV pacing is required. 


She is currently treated with only Lasix 40 mg twice daily, aspirin, hydrocodone. 


She has anaphylaxis to sulfa antibiotics and the aforementioned hypertension with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. 


Social History:  She works as an administrator, stopped smoking, has a 20-pack-year history.  Very rarely drinks alcohol in the past, does not currently drink alcohol.  He is married and lives with her husband. 


Family History:  Notable for potential sudden cardiac death in her mother, longevity in her father and sudden death in her maternal uncles.  Her siblings and children are alive and well, although none have been specifically evaluated for cardiomyopathy. 


Physical Examination:  She appears tachypneic, but well-nourished.  Her blood pressure was 80/60, pulse was 60.  She is afebrile, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.  Clear anicteric sclerae, good dentition.  Clear oropharynx with Mallampatti 1 airway.  Supple neck.  Jugular venous distention to approximately 18 cm of water with prominent CV waves in occasional canon A waves.  Breath sounds were clear.  Normal chest wall morphology palpable parasternal lift, palpable S3, palpable gallop, grade 2 systolic murmur.  Abdomen was soft without hepatosplenomegaly or evidence of ascites.  Extremities were warm with trace edema. 


Electrocardiogram reveals ventricular pacing at 60 beats per minute with AV dissociation and organized atrial activity compatible with sinus bradycardia. 


Labs here reveal a sodium of 137, potassium of 4, BUN of 26, bicarbonate of 20, creatinine of 0.97, calcium of 9, magnesium 2.3, NT-BNP is 39, troponin was negative.  White count 9.7, hematocrit 37, platelets 228.  INR 1.1.  Chest x-ray not performed. 


In summary, Hope Wilson likely has familial disease to account for her cardiomyopathy and conduction disease, although sarcoidosis cannot be excluded given her history of iritis.  There is not appreciable hyperkeratosis of palms or soles or excessively curlier kinky hair to suggest a desmosomal process.  The concomitant AV block, is highly suggestive of lamin related heart disease, although she does not have atrial fibrillation.  On monitor, she has had paroxysms of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, which would be compatible with this diagnosis. 


Currently, she has severe biventricular congestion and NYHA functional class IV symptomatology.   


We will plan the following: 

1.  She will be treated with intravenous furosemide and attempts will be made at reintroduction of neurohormonal antagonists. 

2.  We will discuss genetic testing during this hospitalization. 

3.  Dr. Epstein Service will be in touch regarding potential generator lead revision and upgrade to CRT-D. 

4.  We will work to obtain a cardiac MRI performed previously at UMass Memorial Medical Center. 

5.  We discussed the importance of family screening, given the likely Genetic etiology. 

6. An echocardiogram will be repeated 


Sincerely,

CHIEF COMPLAINT: chest pressure 


HPI: 

Ms. Wilson is a 54 F with idopathic nonischemic cardiomyopathy s/p pacemaker and ICD placement in 2012 who presents with chest pain and dyspnea. She was initially diagnosed with nonsichemic cardiomyopathy in 2011. Since then, she had been doing well until about six months ago when she noticed that her exercise tolerance began to decline and was begun on treatment for worsening heart failure. More recently, she has been having episodes of neck and chest tightness associated with weakness and an increase in her respiratory rate. She first noticed these episodes approx 6 weeks ago but in the past 2 days they have become frequent, occuring multiple times per day. She also notes that she has had significant orthopnea and PND, needing to be almost upright to sleep comfortably. She takes furosemide 80 mg PO daily with an additional 40 mg prn - in the past, when she has had similar symptoms, taking the prn dose provided relief. In the past week, she has taken multiple prn doses but has not noticed much improvement in her symptoms. She also notes that in the past 2 days, her appetite has decreased. She has not noticed any lower extremity edema. She states that her weight today is approximately her dry weight but has increased 1-2 kg from her prior weight. Her symptoms concerned her so she presented to an OSH ED where she was found to be in complete heart block with HRs in the 40s. Her pacemaker backup rate was increased to 60 with improvment (but not complete resolution) of her symptoms. Of note, she was seen in clinic on 1/5 by Dr. Epstein regarding lead-related issues on her device. She was planned for device upgrade here in the near future. As well, she was recommended to f/u with Dr. Lakdawala regarding workup of her cardiomyopathy. In that setting, she was transferred from OSH to BWH for continuity of care. 


In the BWH ED, she was noted to have occasional neck/chest tightness and fatigue although overall improved from her OSH course.

Dear Paul, 


I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Hope Wilson, today in the arrhythmia clinic at the Brigham and Women's Hospital.  As you well know, the patient is a delightful 54-year-old woman who was first diagnosed with a cardiomyopathy back in July 2011.  This is of unclear etiology and she had a left heart cath, which revealed no significant coronary artery disease.  She underwent implantation of a St. Jude medical dual chamber defibrillator on September 27, 2011.  The right atrial lead is a St. Jude 2088, serial number CA4047322 and the RV lead is a St. Jude Durata 7121Q, serial number BNU012286.  The patient has been having increasing heart failure symptoms and is now anywhere between class II to class III.  The last echocardiogram in July 2014 showed an EF of 25%-30%.  She has been noted to have noise on her atrial lead and more recently the threshold on her RV lead has risen significantly.  She underwent DFT testing in August to make sure the device was still functional and it is.  The patient has had ventricular tachycardia treated with antitachycardia pacing since the device was placed. 


Her current medications are Lasix 40 mg b.i.d., aspirin, hydrocodone, and fiber. 


ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers both led to marked reductions in blood pressure and she is not on these medications.  Sulfa caused anaphylaxis. 


Her past medical history is significant for her cardiomyopathy and device history, sick sinus syndrome and some history of intermittent diarrhea. 


Her family history is significant for her mother dying when the patient was 22 due to some sort of heart condition.  All of her mother's brothers also died suddenly.  Father lived to 96 and all of her brothers and sisters are currently well.  She has 4 children. 


She works as an administrator, stopped smoking in 2011 with a 20-year-pack history, drinks 1 caffeinated beverage a day and denies alcohol use. 


Interrogation of her St. Jude device reveals that her threshold was 4.75 volts at 1.2 milliseconds.  In addition, with atrial pacing at 100 beats per minute, she was having block to the ventricle.  Today in clinic, her blood pressure was 99/65 and her pulse was 75 and regular. 


EKG reveals sinus rhythm at 76 beats per minute with a very prolonged PR interval at about 300 milliseconds, right bundle and left anterior fascicle block. 


In summary, the patient is a delightful 54-year-old woman with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and now lead-related issues with her device.  She clearly needs replacement of both her atrial and ventricular leads.  We discussed the options of lead abandonment versus extraction and the patient is amenable to proceeding with extraction understanding the risks.  In addition, although she does not have left bundle-branch block given her very long PR interval, she probably would benefit from ventricular pacing and this would require an LV lead given her reduced ejection fraction and heart failure symptoms.  In addition, I suspect with exercise she is having episodes of block and RV pacing.  In addition, given her family history and no other reason for cardiomyopathy, I think it would be important for her to undergo genetic testing to see if she has a familial cardiomyopathy, especially given that she has 4 children.  I am referring her to Dr. Neal Lakdawala of our service who is an expert in inherited cardiomyopathies.  The patient is amenable to proceeding with extraction and upgrade to a biventricular device and we will make arrangements for this in the near future. 


Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this interesting and delightful patient.  Please do not hesitate to call with any further questions. 


Sincerely,

CC: s/p placement of defibrillator for carnitine induced cardiomyopathy. 


HPI: 
Joshua Gordon is a 17 year old boy who has carnitine deficiency and worsening cardiomyopathy who is admitted s/p placement of BiV defibrillator. Over the course of the last two years there has been a progressive decline in his EF to 40%, then 20%, and now most recently showing an EF of 18%. He is NYHA Class II and gets symptomatic with moderate levels of exertion. 

He is able to do most of his activities at low levels but becomes limited at higher levels of exertion. He has no orthopnea, no PND, no palpitations, no lightheadedness, and no syncope. His parents, however, have noted some decrease in his exercise tolerance over the past two years.  


Today, he had placement of a biventricular ICD. He was sedated using malignant hyperthermia precautions given his carnitine deficiency with propofol and remifentanyl. He was intubated with a 7.5 ETT and had a grade I airway. He received a phenylephrine infusion during the procedure for a few low systolic BPs in the 60s-70s. This was discontinued prior to arrival in the PICU. He was also given Versed 4 mg, Fentanyl 100 mcg, Zofran 4mg, and Ancef 2 gm in the OR. He was given an infusion of nitroglycerin at 17 mcg/min for about 30 seconds due to coronary vasospasm during insertion of the coronary artery lead. The ICD was placed only through an incision in the left upper chest, and did not require femoral catheterization (please see procedure note for full details). He received 1100 cc LR IV, and had 1050 cc UOP. EBL was 50 cc. He was extubated successfully prior to arrival in the PICU. 


On arrival to the ICU, he is comfortable, asking many questions, and in no distress. 

Past medical history:
1) Carnitine deficiency diagnosed in early childhood. 
2) Cardiomyopathy with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and some component of his myocardium appears to be noncompacted

I have seen and evaluated the patient, reviewed all available data (refer to resident note, CAS, flow sheet for additional documentation) with the PICU team.  I agree with the resident note, which reflects our combined evaluation and plan with my edits incorporated.  Care coordinated with cardiology and EP services.  Additional comments: 


17yo with carnitine deficiency, dilated cardiomyopathy, poor ventricular function with posterior inferior wall motion abnormalities and most recent EF of 18%, NYHA Class 2 heart failure. Now s/p attempted resynchronization therapy with BiVent ICD to pace both ventricles and provide option for potential defibrillation with future anticipated dysfunction and impaired cardiac output leading to future arrhythmias. He has tolerated cardiac anesthesia well safely extubated prior to arrival.  Admitted to PICU for recovery of consciousness post anesthesia, and while sleepy initially now awake and answering questions and for cardiac monitoring for complications related to procedure.  Review of monitor reviews occasional PVCs and pacing spikes, indicating pacemaker function. Plan otherwise as above.  Follow glucose given carnitine deficiency.

-General: He is comfortable in the sitting position.
-Skin: : no cyanosis or pallor

 EKG:
 09/19/2011: Heart Rate: 90 BPM. PR interval - 150 msec. QRS duration - 122 msec. Left bundle branch block morphology.

 Other Data:
 His most recent BNP was 1000. 

Echocardiogram performed at Mayo Clinic in April of 2011 showed severe left ventricular enlargement with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and posterior noncompaction. He has increased LV filling pressures with a right ventricular systolic pressure of 39 mmHg. 

Echocardiogram performed at MGH in August of 2011 shows morbid dilatation of the left ventricle with an internal diameter in diastole of 69mm. Left ventricular end diastolic volume is 432 and end systolic volume is 356. Ejection fraction was 18%. RV ejection fraction was 31%. On delayed enhancement there were extensive patchy areas of abnormal delayed left myocardial enhancement involving subepicardial, mid-myocardial,and subendocardial regions; most prominent were at the apex and apical regions. There was also a small area of abnormal delayed myocardial enhancement along the apical free wall of the right ventricle. 

Impression     


 Assessment and plan:
 In summary, it was a pleasure to meet Joshua and his mother. We spent a fair amount of time actually discussing Joshua's clinical condition and the role of defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy. I indicated to them that the progressive decline in Joshua's ejection fraction, and the fact that he is mildly more symptomatic now than he was as compared to before and the fact that he has a wide QRS, certainly makes the case to proceed with resynchronization therapy. Although he is borderline between Class II and Class III, I think in a 17 year old who is showing progressive decline of his ejection fraction, which has now hit the teens, I think intervening prophylactically before he reaches the point of no return makes a lot of sense. He clearly meets all the indications for a defibrillator with a low EF/NYHA Class II-III. 

I discussed at length with them the treatment strategy for him and indicated that we would prefer to have CT venography performed first so that we can get an idea what his coronary venous anatomy looks like. It will be important especially since this kind of cardiomyopathy is rare and I am unclear as to the variability of venous anatomy that may exist in such a situation. I think armed with the venography information we can make a more learned decision as to whether we should proceed with resynchronization therapy and what the approach should be. I say this particularly because of his young age and the uncommon myopathic process that he suffers from. 

I talked at length with them regarding resynchronization therapy. I also explained to Mrs. Gordon that I am unsure as to what the potential response of the myopathic ventricle will be to resynchronization therapy but that we would not know until we have tried. Currently, Joshua appears to be on a trajectory which is moving in the wrong direction and I think it becomes important for us to try whatever we have in our armamentarium to see if we can reverse the process. I will personally review his echocardiogram but I have learned from the MGH echo that he already has wall motion abnormality in the posterolateral and inferoseptal region, and we will make some rough estimates in mechanical dyssynchrony to allow us to estimate the potential success of this procedure. 

I talked at length about the procedure, the success rate, and the response rate, and they wish to proceed. I explained to them the conventional nonresponder percentage is not insignificant and is about 20-25% at MGH. We also touched briefly on surgical implantation of the epicardial lead, but I have decided not to go down that route as of yet. With respect to the procedure, both parents feel that Joshua may benefit more from local anesthesia with conscious sedation, which I think is not unreasonable at all. Of note, Mr. Gordon was conference-called in for the entire consultation from somewhere in South Carolina.

Dear Doctors, 

 Joshua Gordon is a very pleasant 17 year old who has carnitine deficiency and recent onset cardiomyopathy which has been progressively worsening. 

His echocardiograms performed at an earlier age showed a normal ejection fraction but over the course of the last two years there has been a progressive decline in his EF to 40%, then 20%, and now most recently showing an EF of 18%. He is NYHA Class II and gets symptomatic with moderate levels of exertion. 

He is able to do most of his activities at low levels but becomes, as alluded to above, limited at higher levels of exertion. He has no orthopnea, no PND, no palpitations, no lightheadedness, and no syncope. His parents, however, have noted some decrease in his exercise tolerance over the past two years. 

He was recently admitted for a hemodynamic cath and RV biopsy with Dr. Parks. He also had a muscle biopsy at that time. He tolerated the procedure well, save for some extra PVCs for wihch Toprol was added. Two weeks ago at a visit with Dr. Parks, he was mildly volume overloaded and was given a few days of extra lasix. Biopsy results are preliminarily unrevealing but final results are pending. 

He is now scheduled for BiV pacer/ICD placement with Dr. Singh on Wednesday November 30th. He presents today for pre-procedure evaluation. 

He has been well at home, with no fevers, chills, URI, no fatigue, no increased dyspnea on exertion, no chest pain, pressure, palpitations, orthopnea, PND, LE edema, no syncope. He continues to perform his usual daily activities. 

His detailed visit follows. He was accompanied by his mother Carolyn and his father Mark was conferenced in.

Detailed visit note follows. We will see him during his admission next week. They will speak with Dr. Singh regarding beta blockade on the day of the procedure. The requested anesthesiologist will be present. OV 40 min, >50% counseling.

 Interval History:
 Joshua presents today for routine followup after recently undergoing endomyocardial and skeletal muscle biopsy. He Is a 17-year-old gentleman with a history of primary carnitine deficiency who has been noted to have a progressive cardiomyopathy over the last 2 years despite carnitine replacement, therefore he was referred for endomyocardial biopsy to assess for other causes of cardiomyopathy. During his admission, he was placed on telemetry, and was noted to have frequent PVCs. Because of this, he he was given a 24-hour Holter monitor. I reviewed the results of the Holter monitor with him and both parents. He had PVCs approximately 5-7% of the time. He did not have any episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. He had 9 triplets. He had no tachycardia or bradycardia arrhythmias noted.

At the time of his biopsy, he also had a right heart catheterization which revealed modestly elevated filling pressures. Because of this, I increased his Lasix to 40 mg for 3 days, and he will finish his final dose of 40 mg today. Tomorrow he will resume his 20 mg dose. Since being discharged, he has felt well. He has not had any palpitations, syncope or presyncope. No fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting. No chest pain or angina symptoms. No orthopnea and no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. No lower extremity edema.

 Impression:
 17-year-old gentleman with progressive cardiomyopathy in the setting of known primary carnitine deficiency and developmental delay. He is ACC/AHA Stace B and New York Heart Association class II-III.

 Assessment and plan:
 Joshua is stable status post endomyocardial biopsy.
Final pathology results are pending, and I have explained this to his parents. He will be returning in 2 weeks to meet with Dr. Bhatt, and likely we will be able to give him results at that time.

His filling pressures were modestly elevated by right heart cath, and therefore his diuretic regimen was augmented in a short time. He will resume his 20 mg dose of Lasix as of tomorrow. He should continue neurohormonal blockade with carvedilol, valsartan and Aldactone.

He does have a small burden of PVCs. After discussion with Dr. Singh, we have agreed to start him on Toprol 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. for further PVCs progression. He did not have episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. He will continue his carvedilol dose, and ultimately may benefit from transition of carvedilol to Toprol, but I would prefer to do this under close monitoring.

He is a candidate for cardiac resynchronization therapy as well as a prophylactic internal cardioverter defibrillator. He will have this implanted in early December by Dr. Jag Singh.

As per his previous geneticist, If he ever has vomiting, hypoglycemia, poor oral intake, dehydration, altered mental status or metabolic acidosis he should be started on an IV infusion of 10% glucose at 1.5 times maintenance. If he has significant metabolic acidosis, he should be treated with IV sodium bicarbonate to correct acidosis.

I will see him in followup when he presents for his CRT-D device implant.

11/8/11- DPR dictating- Joshua is a 17-year-old young man on whom we were asked to do a skin and muscle biopsy as part of his work-up of carnitine deficiency. He was noted to have a carnitine deficiency a long time ago and has been treated. However, he has developed a significant cardiomyopathy. He is getting a cardiac muscle biopsy today.  


We had a bunch of e-mail discussions about him and I met him this morning.  


He is otherwise a very pleasant young man who is developmentally delayed but does play tennis and likes to sail. His exam otherwise was pretty normal other than some minimally decreased muscle tone.  


He underwent general anesthesia in the cath lab. We did a left thigh skin and muscle biopsy and gave the specimens directly to the technicians for processing. Everything seemed to go well and we got a good closure.  


I think he can travel back home within a couple of days. I discussed all of the aftercare with the parents.

Source of information: Patient, parents and EMR 

CC/reason for admission: s/p RV endomyocardial and L thigh skeletal muscle biopsy 

HPI: Joshua is a 17yo male with PMH of carnitine deficiency, developmental delay and recent onset dilated cardiomyopathy, admitted to the PICU s/p endomyocardial and skeletal muscle biopsies.  After having global developmental delay, frequent AOM and hypotonia from birth, Josh was diagnosed with primary carnitine deficiency at the age of 6.  His ear infections and hypotonia resolved with carnitine supplementation per Mom.  His EF had been normal through 2006 but since that time has decreased from ~60% to 18% in August of this year. Potential causes were thought to be increased growth or insufficient carnitine replacement.  However, despite increased carnitine intake, Josh's last echo in August showed MV regurgitation and possible myocardial scarring with no change in EF.  Muscle biopsies were performed to r/o any undiagnosed causes of cardiomyopathy.  Biopsies were performed under general anesthesia d/t developmental delay and possibility of anxiety.

Post-anesthesia, Joshua had increased secretions and required suctioning but no steroids.  CXR was performed and found LLL atelectasis with mild interstitial edema, but with a patent airway.  His lowest glucose in the OR was 80.

Upon arrival to the PICU, Josh was comfortable and satting well on RA.  He was having sinus brady to the 40s with occasional PVCs.  

PMH:
Carnitine deficiency diagnosed in 2000
Cardiomyopathy: reduced LVEF (NYHA Class II), abnormal WMA of inferoseptal and posterior LV
Developmental delay
Hypotonia
Prophylaxis for multiple AOM

Birth/Developmental Hx:
Josh was born via NSVD at 41 weeks.  Apgars were 8 and 9 and he had mild jaundice at birth.  Josh was hypotonic at birth, sat by 4 months and walked by 24 months.  He has since been diagnosed with "global delay in all spheres."

 Reason for visit:
 Evaluation of cardiomyopathy.

 Interval History:
 This is a 17-year-old gentleman with a history of primary carnitine deficiency who has been noted to have a progressive cardiomyopathy over the last 2 years. He also has a history of developmental delay and hypotonia. He is followed by the congenital heart disease service as well as the mitochondrial clinic. He had an extensive developmental workup at Mayo Clinic in 2000, and testing reportedly documented primary carnitine deficiency. He has been on carnitine supplementation since that time. He has been followed with surveillance echocardiograms, and he has been noted to have a progressive decline in his left ventricular function. Echocardiograms done in the years 2002 to 2006 and 2007 showed ejection fraction greater than 55%. Ejection fraction in 2009 showed 40% by August 2011, his LVEF was 27%. By cardiac MRI, his LVEF was noted to be 18%, with biventricular dysfunction. His myocardial decline has occurred in the setting of adequate carnitine replacement.

In terms of his functional status, Joshua try to maintain an active life. He plays tennis every couple of weeks, and last played 2 weeks ago, at low exertion levels. He rides a bicycle with his father every Saturday, usually cycling for about 30 minutes. He himself does not report symptoms of dyspnea, but his mother tells me that his exercise tolerance has declined over the past year. She also notes that he had to stop several times when walking through the hallways at MGH today. He does not have orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. No lower chimney edema. No palpitations or syncope. He occasionally has presyncope. Since his myocardial function has declined, he has been maintained on carvedilol, valsartan and Aldactone for neurohormonal blockade.

 Past medical history:
 1) Carnitine deficiency diagnosed in 2000.

 Other Data:
 8/30/11 cardiac MRI
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Findings consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy, with 
 biventricular abnormal heterogeneous pattern of delayed myocardial 
 enhancement (extensive in the LV and small in RV), suggestive of 
 myocardial scarring. 
 2. Marked depression of LV function with diffuse severe LV 
 hypokinesis. LVEF: 18%.
 3. Moderate mitral valve regurgitation.
 4. Increased linear signal intensities in the left lower lobe, which 
 probably represent atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be 
 completely excluded. This could be further assessed with chest 
 radiograph. Another possibility is asymmetric pulmonary edema, with 
 predominant involvement of the left lower lobe possibly due to MR jet 
 into left inferior pulmonary vein.

 Impression:
 17-year-old gentleman with progressive cardiomyopathy in the setting of known primary carnitine deficiency and developmental delay. He is ACC/AHA Stace B and New York Heart Association class II-III.

 Assessment and plan:
 While cardiomyopathy can be associated with carnitine deficiency, it is usually quite responsive to carnitine for placement. This raises the question as to whether or not he has something else mediating his cardiomyopathy, as his progressive decline has occurred in the setting of adequate carnitine replacement. He has a significant amount of scarring in his left ventricle with some scarring in his right ventricle as well demonstrated on MRI. I am concerned that he has a process that is not reversible, as he has not responded to modest doses of normal blockade. 

He is clinically euvolemic, and only requiring low doses of Lasix. He is on a good medical regimen to treat his heart failure, and his carvedilol should be further up titrated as tolerated. I would recommend that he undergo endomyocardial biopsy to rule out any undiagnosed causes of his cardiomyopathy, and also to help further prognosticate his cardiomyopathy. He is a very nervous, and with his developmental delay, it is unlikely that he would tolerate conscious sedation. I recommend that he have general anesthesia during his endomyocardial biopsy. Shortly after his endomyocardial biopsy is performed, he will have a skeletal muscle biopsy, as requested by Dr. Sims of the mitochondrial clinic.

He had a cardiopulmonary exercise test, however, he achieved a submaximal exercise and a peak VO2 was unable to be calculated. In the future, I would like to repeat this test so that we may further prognosticate him.

He has been seen by Dr. Singh of the electrophysiology service. I support the notion that he undergo placement of a CRT-D device, to help assist in reverse remodeling and also for prevention of sudden cardiac death.

Given his carnitine deficiency, it is very important that he does not have prolonged periods of being n.p.o. When he presents to the cath lab in the morning, he should be started on D5 normal saline immediately. 

As per his previous geneticist, If he ever has vomiting, hypoglycemia, poor oral intake, dehydration, altered mental status or metabolic acidosis he should be started on an IV infusion of 10% glucose at 1.5 times maintenance. If he has significant metabolic acidosis, he should be treated with IV sodium bicarbonate to correct acidosis.

I have not made any changes to his current medication regimen, and I will see him in followup when he presents for his CRT device. This will serve as his admission note on the day of his biopsy.

Patient Name:  GORDON, JOSHUA S                         

MRN:  5060663 

Date of Visit:  10/05/2011 


This 17-year-old young man is kindly referred by Dr. Amy Bhatt, MGH Cardiology. He has a history of carnitine deficiency and cardiomyopathy as well as developmental delay and hypotonia. I have for review laboratory results, MGH LMR records and a medical genetics note from Dr. Babovic-Vuksanovic dated 7/26/2011. Mother is here with Joshua.  


Pregnancy history was relatively unremarkable. The child was born by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery after 24 hours at 41 weeks. This was the 1st and only pregnancy for this mother. She had had multiple UTIs and was treated with antibiotics during her pregnancy. There was mild meconium. The fetus was monitored during labor and Apgars were 8 and 9. He had mild jaundice not requiring treatment and he went home as expected for a newborn.  


DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: Mother says he was always somewhat floppy and hypotonic. He sat by 4 months. He never really crawled. He pulled to stand at 23 months and began to walk relatively independent at 24 months. In regards to language, he also showed in general delay only using single syllabuses at 18 months. This latter prompted a developmental assessment and testing at about 18 months of age. I do not have these records but mother recounts of a global developmental delay in all spheres.  


In 2000, he did have a developmental workup which was quite extensive at Mayo. Results of laboratory testing, I believe, documented primary carnitine deficiency (I do not have these original records). I do see carnitine supplementation was given and plasma carnitine levels as well as acylcarnitine levels from 2000 to 2005 supported treatment with carnitine.  


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  A number of otitis medias, never had myringotomy tubes. This was not felt to be a significant issue in regards to language development. He was put on antibiotics multiple times and eventually on prophylactic medications. Hearing tests have by mother's report always been normal.  


Developmental history showed slow and gradual acquisition of gross motor, fine, language and social skills without history of regression. When he was sick he would lose some language skills that were at the time being consolidated but there was always quick recovery after the illness ended. He played soccer and T-ball but was never quite as athletic as his peers. He also plays tennis, he sails, he bikes, taking it at a slow pace.  


SCHOOLING: He has been home schooled for the last 3 years to minimize the emotional stress in regards to his developmental delay.  


CARDIOMYOPATHY:  In regards to cardiomyopathy, it was followed at Mayo with multiple echoes. There was significant falloff, although no clinical history that supported acute change in his exercise tolerance. By 2009 his ejection fraction had fallen from normal levels to 40%. Subsequently echoes in 2010 and 2011 have shown decreasing ejection fraction down to the 23% to 24% range and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. He is now being seen by Dr. Bhatt for further evaluation and management.  


In regards to diagnostic workup many studies were unremarkable (see below laboratory data), but in July 2010 a workup indicated 2 molecular lesions. He was identified to carry 1 point mutation in the SCLC 22a5 (OCTN2) gene by sequence (c.364G>T) (p.D122Y).  

This single allele in the carnitine transporter gene presumably supports the diagnosis of primary carnitine deficiency and cardiomyopathy. Through Baylor testing a MitoMet oligo array failed to show evidence of large deletion or duplication in the OCTN2 gene. MLPA or other more quantitative assay for deletion has not been done. It remains that only a single mutation allele has been identified.  


He also had arrayCGH done, which showed interstitial deletion in 13q12.12. The deletion spanned 1.2 megabases and is reported to include approximately 8 genes (details are not given in lab report). This interstitial deletion has apparently also been documented in Joshua's father (I do not have this report nor do I know that these deletions have been compared and that they are absolutely identical).  


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No known hepatic or renal disease. Growth has been good. Hearing and vision are normal.  

- No history of migraine, complex migraine, TIA or strokelike symptoms.   

- Sleep is only problematic because of diuretic use in the context of the cardiomyopathy. Sleep is restorative. Diet is healthy and normal.  

- From 2007 to 2008, he was treated with ADD medications including Adderall, which made him paranoid and clonidine which made aggression a problem.  


MEDICATIONS:  

1. Carnitor 96 mL daily (if this is standard formulation this would equal 9600 mg daily or approximately 160 mg/kg day. Mother has found literature primarily from Dr. Longo University of Utah who is expert in this disorder recommending dosing from 100 to 400 mg/kg day.)  

2. Carvedilol 2.5 mg b.i.d.  

3. (Dictation Anomaly) (09:15) 160 mg b.i.d.  

4. Coenzyme Q10 100 mg b.i.d.  

5. Digoxin 250 mcg daily.  

6. Aldactone 25 mg daily.  

7. Lasix 20 mg daily.  

8. Fish oil.  


ALLERGIES: No known medication allergies.  

1. Adderall, paranoid.  

2. Clonidine, aggression.  


FAMILY HISTORY: A full pedigree is taken and placed in the chart. Joshua is the only child of these parents. Mother carries the same mutation as her son (OCTN2) gene and by verbal report, his father carries the same interstitial deletion 13q12.12. Neither parent has symptoms of developmental delay, hypotonia or cardiomyopathy. The father, himself, does participate in some sports and is relatively active, but this may be less so than his age-matched peers.  


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Height 5 feet 11 inches. Weight 140 pounds. Joshua is very happy, engaged, happy to watch his movie while we reviewed his medical and developmental history. There were no outbursts. His thinking is cognitively delayed and quite concrete but he is eager to participate. No overt staring spells or other manifestations of seizures were noted during the 2-hour visit.  

Cranial Nerve Examination: Fundi unremarkable without evidence of pigmentary retinopathy or optic neuropathy. A visual acuity, although not formally tested seems normal. Visual fields appear somewhat constricted although again behavioral aspects of testing might be causing inattention. This did seem to be most prominent in the lower visual fields bilaterally. No evidence of ophthalmoplegia. Pursuit is smooth. Visual refixation is relatively normal. Sensation of the face seems normal. Facial mobility is symmetric. Hearing is intact to finger rub and voice discrimination, bedside testing. Lower cranial nerves are normal.  

Motor exam shows a generalized hypotonia. Strength is full without pronator drift. No Gower. No dystonia or tremor or choreoathetosis. Fine motor movements are somewhat awkward but not asymmetric.  

Deep tendon reflexes are present and not hyperactive and symmetric. No ankle clonus. Toes are downgoing.  

No evidence of dysmetria, truncal titubation or ataxia. Gait shows normal base, he turns with stability. He can do tandem walk reasonably well. He runs in slightly uncoordinated fashion, but without asymmetry.  

General exam shows no evidence of skin pigmentation abnormalities. No kyphoscoliosis. Cardiopulmonary exam shows a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. No rhythm abnormalities noted.  


LABORATORY DATA:  

Array CGH (Mayo; 11/01/2010) interstitial deletion 13q12.12, approximately 1.2 megabases. This deletion was confirmed with FISH studies.  


Routine chromosomes - unremarkable including Williams syndrome and 22q11.2 duplication and deletion testing was normal.  


OCTN2 gene sequencing identified single point mutation c.364G>T, p.d]D122Y (exon one) predicted to be deleterious by SIFT and PolyPhen aspartic acid is evolutionarily conserved at position 122 from chicken to humans. No 2nd deletion duplication mutation was identified by MicroMet oligo array CGH (Baylor). No MLPA has been done, as far as I know. 

Mother apparently carries this same point mutation.  


Cranial MRI (10/2000) showed no abnormalities of myelin or anatomic structure. No MRS or MRA was done.  


Skin biopsy (8/2001) showed no evidence of storage.  


Plasma carnitine values, the earliest of which I have is 2000 October, show no deficiency and actually this, with the acylcarnitines gathered at similar times, suggests carnitine administration. I have nothing in the lab reports which documents the primary carnitine deficiency. 


Coenzyme Q testing in plasma showed a deficiency and first noted in 2004. Total Co-Q10 0.496 (0.5 to 1.5) by April 2011, this has been repleted with increased ratio of reduced to oxidized Co-Q10 that is now within normal limits.  


Echocardiograms have shown a fall in ejection fraction. Those in the 2002 to 2006 and 2007 years showed ejection fraction greater than 55%. Ejection fraction in 2009 showed 40% by July 2011 ejection fraction is measured at 24% to 29% in association with severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Coronary CTA (April 2011, Mayo) was normal.  


MGH CARDIAC STUDIES:  

Cardiac MRI (8/30/2011) showed dilated cardiomyopathy with abnormal heterogeneous pattern of delayed myocardial enhancement (extensive in LV and small in RV) suggestive of myocardial scarring. There was also marked depression of LV function with diffuse severe LV hypokinesis. LVEF: 18%. Moderate mitral valve regurgitation.  


Cardiac ultrasound (8/29/2011) ejection fraction measured at 27%. That there was structurally normal heart but a dilated cardiomyopathy with left atrial enlargement. RV size and function are within normal limits. Estimated RV pressure was slightly elevated.  


Pulmonary exercise study (9/12/2011) showed submaximal effort. Incomplete study.  


CMPs have been normal. Serum creatinine has been normal. Ammonia has been normal. Plasma lactates have ranged from 1.2 to 1.6.  


Other diagnostic testing which has been normal has included transferrin assay for carbohydrate deficient glycoprotein syndrome (2001), urine amino acids as well as urinary organic acids and urinary acylglycines. Plasma acylcarnitines have shown increase in acylcarnitine carnitine consistent with supplementation, but otherwise have been normal.  


Only measurements I see of free fatty acids were done in 2005 and appear modestly elevated.  


IMPRESSION: A 17-year-old boy with history of global developmental delay without regression, hypotonia and a now dilated cardiomyopathy of clinical significance. Report suggests there is primary carnitine deficiency although I do not have the lab results prior to carnitine supplementation, which would support this. Also documented is that coenzyme Q10 deficiency with resolution after supplementation.  


My summary would be that this probably is primary carnitine deficiency with clinical features of cardiomyopathy. Global developmental delay and hypotonia may be also subsumed under this primary diagnosis. Since only 1 mutational allele to date has been identified in the OTCN2 (carnitine transporter gene) either there is another small deletion or promoter or intronic mutation of significance. I would also consider that this may be compound autosomal recessive disorder with a single predisposing mutation in OTCN2 and a 2nd interstitial deletion he had inherited from his father in chromosome 13q12.12. We will explore this latter by looking at genomic databases to identify the included genes in this deletion as noted above we will try to compare this to be specific physical deletion delineated in the father. Father and son may be a candidate for DEGAP Research Program and we will explore this possibility with these researchers.  


Family's major concern at this point is to optimize therapy, particularly carnitine.  


PLAN: 

1.  I would also advocate for more aggressive coenzyme Q10 repletion, as this may also augment metabolic support. The clinical history although his developmental issues and hypotonia suggests some generalized neurologic effect, does not support the episodic and regressive quality of an oxidative phosphorylation disorder.  


2.  Nonetheless, it would not be unreasonable to pursue further diagnostic testing in regards to possible mitochondrial disorder. We have discussed this with the family and the mother will consider this going forward. At this point repletion of carnitine and coenzyme Q and continued cardiac evaluation and decisions about further management are primary targets of medical care.  


3.  We would recommend increase in carnitine gradually to the maximum dose suggested by Dr. Longo of 400 mg/kg day. This may not be tolerated from a GI point of view but this remains reasonable goal. Once this is reached maximal management and dosing, I would suggest increasing coenzyme Q10 dosing to at least at 10 mg/kg and if tolerated (disruption of sleep, GI distress) to 20 mg/kg.  


4.  We have asked that Joshua be enrolled in our Mitochondrial Registry and BioRepository.  


5.  We would like to receive results from father's array CGH. It would be potentially of significant research value to compare the actual interstitial deletions between father and son to see if they are identical. Father should also been seen from a clinical point of view to see if he may manifest subclinical signs of this deletion.  


6.  Followup in 4 months' time and we remain available on a p.r.n. basis.

RE: CHF management and new RV failure


 55 yo M with hx of asthma, HTN, CAD s/p CABG, CHF, DM, and a.fib s/p ablation who presented to PCP's clinic today c/o significant SOB limiting ambulation to several steps at a time after derm appt earlier in the day (were dx with tinea pedia and given steroid cream for poss Grovers on back) with reports of increased abd girth and LE edema L>R. In clinic sats 88% on RA up to mid 90s on 2L. No CP reported in clinic although pt reports MI in 2000 was also without CP.

Was seen earlier in the month at urgent care for leg pains that were keeping up at night which were treated with naproxyn. The patient had called Dr Heist who recommended that he be seen in urgent care. Device was interrogated as well and showed an episode of NSVT. For the past three weeks he's noticed increased abd girth with feelings like he is bloated accompanied by decreased BMs and decreased urinary flow despite increasing his lasix to 80mg PO BID. He notes that his BP and DM have been under very good control recently which he attributes to strict diet and exercise regimen. The patient states that he is very aware of his symptoms and he has had a feelign that things were gettign worse. 

On the day of admission the patient reports that he was at Staniford street for a dermatology apt. He was walking out to his car in the parking lot and had to stop 3 times within a distance of 150 feet because of DOE. His SOB was so profound that when he left his apt he drove to MGH to be seen. Historically within the last few weeks he reports that he has been unable to walk to his barn without stopping several times. When conducting lessons in the morning, he states that it takes all afternoon to recover from severe SOB and fatigue. 

In the ED the pt was noted to have abd distension and swollen legs L > R. Concern for PE or rt sided heart failure prompted LENIs which were negative. abd US showed perihepatic ascites and enlarged spleen. CXR showed no infiltrate or effusion. PECT was negative for clot showing only enlarged pul artery. Upper abd on PECT didn't show masses or tumors but exam limited. Twice in the ED the pt noted some discomfort and was found to have blood sugars in the 60s requiring 2amps total of D50. No evening lantus was given and the pt had not eaten. He got 1L IVF after the contrast for concerns of renal failure.

insufficiency. There is right atrial dilatation. There are pacemaker wires
noted in the right heart. The superior-inferior RA dimension is 58 mm (normal
range: up to 49 mm). The medial-lateral RA dimension is 47 mm (normal range up
to 46 mm).

PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A. 
There is evidence of trace pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral
Doppler. The RV systolic pressure was estimated from the regurgitant tricuspid
velocity (assuming an RA pressure of 10mmHg). The estimated RV systolic
pressure is 57 mmHg.

RIGHT VENTRICLE 
The right ventricle is dilated. (49 mm at base) The right ventricle is
diffusely hypokinetic.

INTERATRIAL SEPTUM, INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM 
There is no obvious evidence of a patent foramen ovale by colod Doppler or
agitated saline contrast at rest of with Valsalva.

PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES 
There is no evidence of pericardial effusion. There is a space between
visceral and parietal pericardium most c/w pericardial fat.

CONCLUSIONS 

Compared to the study of 09/20/2012, there is evidence of moderate TR on the
current study, the RVSP has increased, the RV is dilated and the LV is now
diffusely hypokinetic and the LVEF has decreased from 37% to 26%.

KNIGHT CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION LABORATORY FINAL REPORT

 PATIENT NAME: YUNITS, ROBERT MRN:2380494
 AGE: 54
 CASE DATE/TIME: 9/21/2012 2:37 PM
 DIAGNOSTIC ATTENDING MD: Joseph Garasic, M.D.
 DIAGNOSTIC FELLOW MD: Sunil Kapur, M.D.
 INTERVENTIONAL FELLOW MD: Amey R. Kulkarni, M.D.
 INDICATION(S): Afib pre-ablation / Abnormal ETT / Atypical CP Atrial 
 fibrillation

OVERALL SUMMARY:

 LM - patent
 LAD - 70% disease in distal segment of proximal artery, then is 
 occluded in mid-vessel / D1 60-70% ostial stenosis / S1 has 70% ostial 
 stenosis
 LCX - 40% mid-vessel disease / no patent obtuse marginal branches
 RCA - dominant / diffuse 20% proximal and mid-vessel ISR / PDA has 20% 
 proximal disease / PLV is patent
 LIMA to LAD - patent
 SVG's known occluded and not imaged on this study given CRI and desire 
 to minimize contrast.
 RECOMMENDATIONS: - Large territory of unrevascularized (and apparently 
 infarcted) lateral wall
 - SVG's not imaged to minimize contrast but known occluded
 - No culprit site for PCI
 - TR band to left wrist x 3 hours
 - Findings communicated to Dr Heist

 DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUE: Under Lidocaine 2% local anesthesia a 5F 
 introducer was placed in the right radial artery using modified 
 Seldinger technique. Selective coronary arteriography was then 
 performed using a 5 F Judkins left number 4 catheter to engage the 
 left coronary artery and a 5 F Judkins right number 4 catheter to 
 engage the right coronary artery. Right and left coronary arteriography 
 were performed in multiple views by hand injections of Ultravist. 
 Following the procedure, the sheaths were removed. Selective left 
 internal mammary graft angiography was then performed using Judkins 
 rightnumber 4 catheter to engage the arterial graft conduit to the left 
 anterior descending artery. Angiography was performed in multiple views 
 by hand injections of Ultravist. 
 Joseph Garasic, M.D. was present for the critical portions of the 
 procedure and immediately available throughout the entire procedure.

 HEMODYNAMICS: 

 STATE:Rest
 Heart rate (bpm):71

 PRESSURES: 
 AO 93 / 63 / 76

 CORONARY ANATOMY FINDINGS: 
 Dominance: Right
 Left Main: The left main coronary artery is of moderate length, 
 intermediate sized vessel. It bifurcates into the LAD and LCX coronary 
 arteries. Left main coronary artery is normal. 
 LAD: The left anterior descending artery is large vessel, which does 
 not reach the apex of the heart and gives origin to two moderate sized 
 diagonal arteries. The Proximal LAD has a focal 70 % stenosis in its 
 mid third. The Mid LAD is totally occluded in its mid third. The 1st 
 Diagonal has a focal 70 % stenosis in its ostium. The LAD SP has a 
 focal 70 % stenosis in its ostium.. 
 Left Circumflex: The left circumflex coronary artery is small vessel, 
 which gives origin to none obtuse marginal arteries.
 The mid Circumflex has a focal 40 % stenosis in its mid third.
 RCA: The right coronary artery is a large vessel. The Mid RCA vessel 
 is diffusely diseased. The Right PDA has a focal 20 % stenosis in its 
 proximal third. 
 Grafts: The Single LIMA graft to Mid LAD is patent. Other SVG's 
 known to be occluded were not imaged.

 Assessment and plan:
 55 yo M with hx of asthma, HTN, CAD s/p CABG, CHF, DM, and a.fib s/p ablation who presents with worsening exertional SOB and abdominal girth.

Assessment and Plan: 
Ischemic cardiomyopathy - s/p CABG with sichemic CM however EF on recent ECHO has now decreased to 26%. Device was interrogated showing an episode of NSVT. Pt reports that his symptoms have acutely worsened over the last 3 weeks. Now has severe right sided failure. Unlikely new ischemic event. RV hypokinesis is new however on CCL less tha one year ago the RCA was noted to have 20% stenosis. I dont feel at this time that repeat coronary angio would eb benficial. 
.
Congestive heart failure - New right sided failure with RV hypokinesis suggesting that this is not ischemia. he now has moderate TR and RA likely cuase is pulmonary HTN. RVSP was elevated on TTE. Coincidently weight drastically increased over the last 6-8 months since starting Prednisone. He was previously 219 lbs now 260. Pt reports strict med compliance which i dont have concerns about. he also has immense self awareness in regards to his symptoms. Known sleep apnea with mask. Failure is certainly multifactorial however it would be prudent to create immediate symptomatic relief while considering this patient for advanced treatment modalities depending on underlying etiology.
 - RECs:
- daily weight prior to breakfast
- strict I and O
- 2 gm sodium restriction
- nutrition consult
- 2L fluid restriction
- aggressively diurese for TBB goal negative 1-2l a day. Increase Lasix to 40mg IV TID. Certainly can consider giving Torsemide if he doesnt put out.
- RHC for monday
- CPET Tuesday
- pending his results of testing may consider candidacy for BiVAD vs tx. 
- may benefit from upgrade to CRT. QRS is borderline. Appreciate EP following. 

Habits/Risk Screening: 
Activity level: active Swimming 2 hours a day
Smoking status: never smoked second hand smoke working at bar from 18 years old to 40 years
Alcohol use status: none/minimal

Personal data and overall health 
 He has been involved with horse work since his childhood, currently runs a horse farm with his significant other, Michael Bruce. They have been together for 28 years. He himself exercises regularly, mostly swimming and water aerobics. Michael and he have three employees.

Reason for visit 
 SOB

History of present illness 
 Referred to ER from IMA Urgent care with SOB. Had called earlier in the day from Derm to report increased DOE and LE edema and increased abd. Sat 88%. He reports that yesterday AM he felt well and had swam his usual 1-2 hours before coming in for an elective derm appt. 

He has had abd swelling over the last few weeks. 

His sugars have been very tightly managed with Lantus and short acting (not his usual pattern but he is determined to improve his A1c) 

ER eval included a neg CTPE, LE US. CT showed huge liver and spleen

Problems

Anticoagulation
At this point, he is on aspirin only.

Asthma
MDIs

Congestive heart failure
2012: The left ventricular cavity size is dilated. The left ventricular systolic function is impaired. There is segmental left ventricular dysfunction (see wall motion plot). There is focal wall thinning and increased reflectivity of the septal, lateral and posterior territories suggesting a left ventricular scar. The estimated ejection fraction is 37 %. LVEF was measured by the single dimension method

Coronary artery disease
Started begin at age 37, when he was diagnosed with diabetes. In 200, at age 43, while traveling in the Dominican Republic, he developed a shortness of breath and chest heaviness. He treated initially for pneumonia, and returned to the states, developed shortness of breath and was transported from the airport to hospital and then ultimately to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery x3. He had a LIMA to the LAD and has superficial femoral artery graft to OM and diagonal branches. 

He underwent cardiac catheterization in 2007, which revealed that the only the LIMA had survived. He underwent an echocardiogram in November 2011, which showed an EF of 35%-40%, diffuse right and left ventricular hypokinesis and akinesis. Stress test at that time showed an anterior scar, EF of 27%. 

Admit 9/12: ST There is a large, completed lateral infarct extending into the apex. There is a large territory of mild anterior ischemia. The LVEF is 38% with mild left ventricular dilatation at rest with diffuse hypokinesis and lateral akinesis. There are no prior studies for comparison. 

US: The left ventricular cavity size is dilated. The left ventricular systolic function is impaired. There is segmental left ventricular dysfunction (see wall motion plot). There is focal wall thinning and increased reflectivity of the septal, lateral and posterior territories suggesting a left ventricular scar. The estimated ejection fraction is 37 %. LVEF was measured by the single dimension method. 

Cath: 
LM - patent 
LAD - 70% disease in distal segment of proximal artery, then is occluded in mid-vessel / D1 60-70% ostial stenosis / S1 has 70% ostial stenosis 
LCX - 40% mid-vessel disease / no patent obtuse marginal branches 
RCA - dominant / diffuse 20% proximal and mid-vessel ISR / PDA has 20% 
proximal disease / PLV is patent 
LIMA to LAD - patent 
SVG's known occluded and not imaged on this study given CRI and desire 
to minimize contrast. 

Diabetes mellitus
He is now followed more closely by Dr. Redgrave at the Brigham. Dr. Redgrave has maintained the current high dose Lantus and has instituted a more aggressive Humalog program. He is not consistly compliant due to dietary issues and distractions

Edema
He has mild lower extremity edema, probably multifactorial, possibly related to mild heart failure, but more likely related to his venous insufficiency.

Hymenoptera hypersensitivity
He does plan to undergo desensitization, he will hook up with the Faulkner Hospital to get the injections.

Hypercholesterolemia
Pravachol therapy, 

Hypertension
Recent downward med adjustment due to lower readings

Leg pain
Seen 3/13 with acute onset of diffuse LE pain. Tx with Naprosyn 500 bid. CRP elevated but RF, ESR and ANA neg. .

Neuropathy
He describes a discomfort that occurs in the lateral anterior portion of his right greater than left thigh. This has been present off and on, he describes mostly a burning sensation. Myelogram two to three years ago apparently showed disc disease, but nothing significant. At this point, his description in the location and the fact that he has a slight decrease in sensation in the lateral aspect of his right thigh all suggest lateral femoral cutaneous nerve impingement found in meralgia paresthetica. We will follow and I have asked him to remove the wallet from the right side of his trousers.

Sleep apnea
Using sleep device regularly.

Vitamin D deficiency
2000 unit per day.

Atrial fibrillation, STATUS POST
Admit 9/28/12: 1) Left atrial circumferential ablation procedure with isolation of all pulmonary veins 2) Left atrial roof line 

Hyperthyroidism, STATUS POST
Identified in the spring of 2011, initially attributed to amiodarone. He continued to have issues off and on through 2011 as far as I can tell, the exact timing is not entirely clear. He was on antithyroid medication as well as high dose prednisone. The antithyroid medication was discontinued. He was initially on 40 mg of prednisone which has been weaned.

Dyspnea (on exertion)
More severe

Changes to Allergies
AMIODARONE - reaction: Hyperthyroidism [reviewed]
capers - reaction: Vomiting [reviewed]

Age 50-75 years: 0-900 pg/ml 
Age >75 years: 0-1800 pg/ml 

Among patients with dyspnea, NT-proBNP is highly sensitive for the detection 
of acute congestive heart failure. In addition, a NT-proBNP <300 pg/ml 
effectively rules out acute congestive heart failure, with 99% negative 
predictive value. 

Knowledge of each individual patient's NT-proBNP range may be more useful 
than using similar cut-points for every patient. 

Marked elevations in NT-proBNP levels may be observed in states other than 
left ventricular congestive heart failure, including: acute coronary 
syndromes, right heart strain/failure (including pulmonary embolism and cor 
pulmonae), critical illness, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, as well as 
advanced age. 

Falsely low NT-proBNP in congestive heart failure patients may be observed 
with increasing body-mass index.

 ventricle. 

 Lungs and Airways: The lungs and airways are normal with no focal 
 abnormality demonstrated. 

 Pleura: The pleural spaces are clear. 

 Heart and mediastinum: The thyroid gland is normal. There are 
 multiple prominent mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes. There 
 are stable right paratracheal lymph nodes measuring up to 1.4 cm in 
 short axis. There are stable bilateral hilar lymph nodes measuring up 
 to 1.4 cm in short axis. The heart is enlarged with left atrial 
 dilatation. There is no pericardial effusion. The patient is status 
 post CABG. There is atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary 
 arteries and aorta. 

 Soft tissues: Normal. 

 Abdomen: The patient is status post cholecystectomy. Limited 
 contrast-enhanced views of the upper abdomen show no abnormality 
 within the visualized liver, spleen, pancreas, or kidneys. The 
 adrenal glands are normal. 

 Bones: The patient is status post median sternotomy. The visualized 
 skeleton shows degenerative changes. There are no suspicious lytic or 
 blastic lesions. 

 IMPRESSION: 
 Negative for pulmonary embolism. 

 Enlarged main pulmonary artery, which can be seen in pulmonary 
 arterial hypertension. 

 Cardiomegaly with dilated left atrium. 

 Stable prominent mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes.

Attending: John Goodson 

Historian: Pt, chart 


Reason for admission: SOB 


HPI: This is a 55 yo M with hx of asthma, HTN, CAD s/p CABG, CHF, DM, and a.fib s/p ablation who presented to PCP's clinic today c/o significant SOB limiting ambulation to several steps at a time after derm appt earlier in the day (were dx with tinea pedia and given steroid cream for poss Grovers on back) with reports of increased abd girth and LE edema L>R. In clinic sats 88% on RA up to mid 90s on 2L. No CP reported in clinic although pt reports MI in 2000 was also without CP. 

Was seen earlier in the month at urgent care for leg pains that were keeping up at night which were treated with naproxyn. For the past two weeks he's noticed increased abd girth with feelings like he is bloated accompanied by decreased BMs and decreased urinary flow despite increasing his lasix to 80mg PO BID. He notes that his BP and DM have been under very good control recently which he attributes to strict diet and exercise regimen. 

In the ED the pt was noted to have abd distension and swollen legs L > R. Concern for PE or rt sided heart failure prompted LENIs which were negative. abd US showed perihepatic ascites and enlarged spleen. CXR showed no infiltrate or effusion. PECT was negative for clot showing only enlarged pul artery. Upper abd on PECT didn't show masses or tumors but exam limited. Twice in the ED the pt noted some discomfort and was found to have blood sugars in the 60s requiring 2amps total of D50. No evening lantus was given and the pt had not eaten. He got 1L IVF after the contrast for concerns of renal failure. DDx of pt's sx is broad - he is being admitted for further w/u and evaluation. 


Plt down and bili up. 

got 1L fluid after contrast for CT 

twice in ED sugars in 60s when pt c/o discomfort - pt denies extra insulin. got 2 amps d50 but not eaten in ED. 

EKG unchanged from prior.

Impression/Plan:  

55 yo M with hx of asthma, HTN, CAD s/p CABG, CHF, DM, and a.fib s/p ablation who presents with 2w LLE swelling, increased abd girth, SOB, mild elevation of LFTs with drop in Plts and increased splenic size.  

Cardiac - CHF with EF 37% 9/2012 with AICD last interrogated 2w ago, a.fib s/p ablation. RUQ US suggest poss rt sided failure/congestion and PECT shows increased pulm vessels. Consider TTE for right sided function evaluation. r/o for MI. continue dig, irbasartan, B-blocker. Low salt diet. 

Pulm - asthma - stable, continue inhalers. Pt on CPAP at night - will get resp therapy to place - continue 2L O2 NC wean as tolerates. No PNA on CXR, no sign of acute infection, no PE on CT. unlikely primary pulm abnormality. 

Abd/GI - elevated biliary enzymes with perihepatic ascites - no indication of tappable pocket of fluid by my exam. RUQ US did not show mass - CT abd may be warranted for poss mass that might be leading to left LE swelling or obstruction for bowel/bladder. laxatives as needed. low plt likely splenic sequestration. etiology of increased girth is not clear at this time. 

Renal - decreased UOP despite increased lasix. etiology not clear. get UA to assess. creat technically normal but rising - will need to adjust meds accordingly - expect bump wtih contrast from PECT. Hold night lsaix for right now. Reassess in AM 

DM - low sugars in ED requiring supp glucose. Held PM lantus. sugars rising with toast/peanut butter/juice on floor. Recheck sugars frequently this morning and adjust as needed. Etiology unclear. Given expected rise in creat holding metformin.

Problems

Leg pain
URGENT CARE:
S: Complaining of severe, 9/10 diffuse pain, especially in the legs, that prevents him from sleeping at night. The patient has a lengthy and complex history that spans several years with diagnostic workup at BW and elsewhere. He says that Dr. Goodson doesn't know what the diagnosis is but we do know:
-he had improvement in symptoms when he was on prednisone
-he had inflammatory markers in 2009 that were impressive: CRP 103, ESR 44.

He has had flareups like he is having now although he says this is a relatively severe one which came on in last two days with no antecedent event or change in medical status that he can think of. He is having difficulty moving around, he describes stiffness in his hands and diffuse joint pain.

O: Overweight man who Has difficulty getting up from sitting position due to pain and possible proximal weakness 
VS see below
It's hard to see any focal abnormalities on his hands and a detailed joint exam was not done because of the focus on his cardiorespiratory complaints as well as the chronicity of this problem. 

A/P: Exacerbation of ? underlying inflammatory condition (given prior history of this pain, history of improvement on prednisone, previous elevatedinflammatory markers. 
P: Given his diabetes will avoid prednisone but ordered Naprosyn 500mg BID prn pain #60
. Ordered ESR, RF, ANA, anti CCP, Creactive protein 
 Will notify Dr. Goodson.
Is it time for him to have a rheumatology consultation?

Atrial fibrillation, STATUS POST
URGENT CARE: The pt originally initiated this visit because of his diffuse flareup in MSK pains as described above but was alarmed this morning by sudden onset of SOB, palpitations. 
The patient underwent ablation several months ago and about 2 wks ago was taken off the last of his antiarrhythmic agents and coumadin. He believes he is having episodes of palpitations - although his perception is atypical - "my breath feels cold", heart beating in his chest but he doesn't count the beats perminute or note irregularity. Coexisted with short episodes and became alarmed this morning when he noted rather sudden onset of dyspnea with exertion, lightheadedness. 
Says he is too short of breath to talk normally - although he is doing so very nicely in the office.

O: BP: 107/69 P: 77, regular RR: 14 O2: 94% (baseline for him) T: 96.3
Pulse currently regular, 77bpm. 
Lungs CTAB, no wheezing or crackles. No orthopnea

EKG with no significant changes from last month is in NSR with first degree AV block, no ectopy, T wave changes seen on prior EKGs as well without change.

A/P: Concern for breakthru afib in pt post-ablation and just taken off meds 2 wks ago. Will be seen immediately by cardiologist Kevin Heist. 

ADDENDUM: Called by Dr Heist who reports that they interrogated his device and he had only one 6 beat run of NSVT several days ago and has had no other significant arrhythmia. He is felt to be stable from cardiac and pulmonary point of view. Pt given this information. 
A: anxiety?
P: reassurance and immediate cardiac input.

Pt  seen and evaluated with Dr. Tedeschi and I agree with the findings/recommendations noted.  Pt with elevated a1c, states he takes humalog 15 units before meals plus SS if BG>100 but pt has rarely been checking premeal BG and therefore rarely using the SS with this.  Also admits he sometimes skips the mealtime humalog.  Reviewed that he really needs this bolus insulin before all his meals as his lantus is inadequate to deal with the mealtime excursions of BG.  As he increases his physical activity, he may need decrease in some of these doses:  I've asked him to send me his BG weekly so this can be done.

Personal data and overall health 
 He is now swimming up to two to three hours on a daily basis,two classes. He is quite enthusiastic about his exercise regimen. His strength and stamina have improved now. He also stretches for about 15 minutes after he exercises.

Reason for visit 
 Diabetes mellitus.

Problems

Anticoagulation
A: At this point, he is on aspirin only.

Asthma
A: Doing quite well, no significant wheeze on examination today.

Congestive heart failure
A: He is doing quite well, I think at some point he should get a repeat echocardiogram to see in fact how his EF has become. He also continues on digoxin. I will ask Dr. Heist at his next visit to decide whether or not he needs to continue on digoxin.

Coronary artery disease
A: No chest pain episodes whatsoever.

Diabetes mellitus
A: He is now followed more closely by Dr. Redgrave. Dr. Redgrave has maintained the current high dose Lantus and has instituted a more aggressive Humalog program. This will require him to check his sugars and report them on a weekly basis 5 to 7 times per day. I have given him a book to record all of this. Hopefully, he can make some progress. His last hemoglobin A1c was not good.

Edema
A: Doing much better, using stockings on both sides, 1+ on the left side, trace on the right today.

Hymenoptera hypersensitivity
A: He does plan to undergo desensitization, he will hook up with the Faulkner Hospital to get the injections.

Hypercholesterolemia
Plan: Recheck on current Pravachol therapy, last values were excellent. We will not check today.

Hypertension
A: His blood pressure readings are actually quite low here today. I am worried that he is getting too low. We will drop his Avapro to 75 mg per day. I have asked him to check and monitor his blood pressure readings at home with the target of greater than 120.

Insomnia
A: Using lorazepam on a consistent basis.

Knee pain
/left. 
A: He is continuing to show improvement with his water aerobics.

Neuropathy
A: He describes a discomfort that occurs in the lateral anterior portion of his right greater than left thigh. This has been present off and on, he describes mostly a burning sensation. Myelogram two to three years ago apparently showed disc disease, but nothing significant. At this point, his description in the location and the fact that he has a slight decrease in sensation in the lateral aspect of his right thigh all suggest lateral femoral cutaneous nerve impingement found in meralgia paresthetica. We will follow and I have asked him to remove the wallet from the right side of his trousers.

Sleep apnea
A: Using sleep device regularly.

Vitamin D deficiency
A: I have asked him to supplement to 2000 unit per day. I will plan to recheck on return visit.

Atrial fibrillation, STATUS POST
A: He has now been taken off the Dofetilide by Dr. Heist. He is now off of the warfarin anticoagulation because he has remained in sinus rhythm following his ablation procedure.

Narrative History 

 "Got aggressive" with checking FSBG and looking at his diet 3 weeks ago.  In the past 2 months he had a lot of health issues -- ankle fracture, afib ablation -- so was physically inactive then.  Again he has pain in both thighs after sitting for a while radiating from the iliac crests to the lateral knees, not bothersome while swimming. Started stretching at swim class. Myelogram normal. Stopped gemfibrozil and pravastatin in the past and the pain resolved -- now resumed pravastatin. ?Was taking cough syrup with sugar (no Rx seen in LMR)


Known complications: possible gastroparesis, periph neuropathy, CAD


Last a1c: 9.2% (2/28/2013)


Currently taking:  Lantus 100U qhs (8pm usually, but last night at midnight), Humalog 15U (if FSBG<100) TID plus sliding scale if FSBG >100. Takes the Humalog 15U with breakfast before he checks his FSBG.


BG log shows:  late morning only 2 readings in total: 287-296.  early afternoon after swimming 112-166.  late afternoon 91-173. 

- patient reports FSBG 287 once in the morning, unclear to him why (ate the night before 10pm).  100-127 fasting.   1pm low 100s (after swimming)

Serious hypoglycemias: felt dizzy and shaky with FSBG 91, once last week at the pool felt shaky and slurred speech, didn't have meter but drank orange juice

Dietary problems:  "could be better" but lost 8 lbs! Breakfast is always yogurt plus blueberrries. Last night chose chicken pot pie over chicken breast. Drinking sugary beverages occasionally. Sometimes related to appointment schedule/eating out. States he knows what is good for him to eat.

RE: atrial fibrillation

Dear Dr. Goodson

 Dr. Heist and I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Yunits in the cardiac arrhythmia clinic on February 28, 2013. He was kindly referred to us by Dr. Goodson for management of his atrial fibrillation and ischemia cardiomyopathy. He was last seen in the cardiac arrhythmia clinic on October 24, 2012. 

You are familiar with his past medical history, we will summarize his history for our own records. Mr. Yunits is a 55-year-old male with the history of ischemia cardiomyopathy s/p CABG in 2000 at Beth Israel Deaconess, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroid attributed to amiodarone toxicity, obstructive sleep apnea, and atrial fibrillation. His atrial fibrillation has been refractory to treatment with Sotalol and Tikosyn, secondary post atrial fibrillation ablation on September 23, 2012. 

Mr. Yunits had a myocardial infarction in 2000 about one month following a cholecystectomy, and subsequently underwent a coronary artery bypass graft at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital. A cardiac catheterization performed for progressive decline in his ejection fraction in February 2007, was notable for patent LIMA to LAD, occluded SVG to OM and occluded SVG to Diag, 95% septal, 90% OM2 (essentially unchanged from prior). In 2007, he was started on amiodarone after a diagnosis of symptomatic atrial fibrillation. He states that he remained in sinus rhythm for years, until this past year in 2011 when he was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism that has been attributed to amiodarone toxicity or thyroiditis. The amiodarone was discontinued last spring (with prednisone treatment for the amiotoxicity, which has been tapered to half), and he subsequently underwent a cardioversion in approximately December 2011. At that time, Dofetilide was started. He was not aware that he has ever been on a dose higher than his present dose of 250 mcg twice a day. 

A Medtronic Virtuoso DR ICD was implanted in February 2008 for a primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. The last interrogation of the device in November 2011 was notable for normal parameters and function, VP less than 1%, and no ventricular high rate episodes. 

He notes that he has been experiencing lower extremity edema since mid November 2011. Around that time, Lasix was started. He was subsequently admitted to Brigham and Women's Hospital in November 2011, for a heart failure exacerbation. An echocardiogram in November 2011 demonstrated mild dilation with an ejection fraction of 35%-40% and mild LVH. There was basal in mid-inferolateral and inferior akinesis. There was a mild right ventricular enlargement and dysfunction. A stress test in December 2011, demonstrated a medium size area of prior MI involving the LCX territory without evidence of residual stress-induced ischemia, several global LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 27%) out of proportion to be extent of infarction. 

Lately he has been suffering from joint pains. He also describes awakening shortness of breath (he has a history of sleep apnea on CPAP) but no dyspnea with exertion and (he exercises frequently with no dyspnea, chest pain or other cardiac symptoms). 

He was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital from September 19, 2012 to September 22, 2012. ECHO showed LVEF 37% with a dilated LA. A stress test suggested ischemic, but cardiac catheterization showed stable CAD. 

On September 20, 2012, he underwent EP study and ablation of AF (PVI and LA roof line) since ablation, he has not noted any symptoms suggestive of AF. He thought that he may have had two ICD shocks, but device interrogation revealed no ICD therapies. There have been no atrial arrhythmias detected since the ablation. He feels fatigue, and has noted swelling in his left leg since he injured it on a scooter accident (the swelling improves when he wears a compression stocking). 

Mr. Yunits is here today for follow up of atrial fibrillation on February 28, 2013. His symptoms for atrial fibrillation include palpitations and cold weather. He has had two episodes of feeling atrial fibrillation shortly after the pulmonary vein isolation in late September 2012. He continues to have lightheaded and dizziness with positional changes. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, edema, and syncope. 

His interrogation of his ICD today revealed nonsustained VT detect less than 1 second on February 9, 2013, at a rate of 214 beats per minute. He is A-sensed at 99% and V-sensed at 99%, his underlying rhythm is at 85 beats per minute. His atrial threshold was increased to 3.1V. 

He continues to have left leg edema after his foot break down in scooter accident and he had his vein graft removed from that leg as well.

Dear Dr. Larson: 


We saw Steven Nelson and his wife in Cardiomyopathy Clinic today.  He is indeed a delightful man with a very unfortunate condition.  As you indicated, he is currently very compromised from both right and left-sided elevated filling pressures.  We admitted him to our Cardiomyopathy Service and tonight we will begin intravenous diuresis.  As his overall ejection fraction, as you indicated is markedly reduced, we will also begin pursuing questions of whether or not a cardiac transplant might be appropriate.  His Marfan's syndrome is an issue, as patients have increased risk of dissection on immunosuppression.  Nonetheless, I hope that this will be found to be an option for him if he does not otherwise stabilize for a period of time. 


We will be in touch with you after further evaluation and therapy in the hospital.  I appreciate the opportunity to work with you in caring for this very pleasant gentleman. 


Sincerely,

IDENTIFICATION:  This 50-year-old bus driver with Marfan's syndrome presents with ascites and resting dyspnea that have been worsening over the past four months.  He underwent mitral valve and aortic valve repair in 11/2007 complicated by a perioperative inferior myocardial infarction. 


He has essentially no prior history except knowledge of a murmur since his teens.  He was last follow up during a period of time and presented in summer of 2007 with atrial fibrillation.  His symptoms improved after cardioversion at that time, but then worsened again in the fall.  His ejection fraction was 40%, he had normal coronary arteries, and an aortic dimension of 4.6 cm, some aortic regurgitation.  During the surgery, he had an Alfieri suture, with residual mitral regurgitation treated with a ring and a leaflet resection.  He had MB of 672.  Postoperatively, with inferior ST segment changes.  He was on epinephrine and milrinone postoperatively.  His aorta was felt not to be significantly dilated when visualized directly. 


He had recurrent atrial fibrillation in January.  After cardioversion, he did not feel significantly better.  He also had an episode diagnosed as pneumonia generate but has had a persistent cough since that time.  He has gained approximately 18 pounds over the past three months with marked decrease in his appetite.  He feels short of breath at rest and particularly at night, when he often awakes very anxious.  He has noticed increasing abdominal swelling.  This has improved since Dr. Herson initiated furosemide one week ago, but is still very limiting.  He has had no chest discomfort.  He has had no recurrence of palpitations since his cardioversion in January. 


FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for son who has had Marfan's syndrome with aortic aneurysm surgery.  His father had multiple medical problems and died in the hospital in his 60s.  Interestingly, on his mother's side, he has two uncles who died suddenly in their 50s without prior known cardiac disease. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for mild psoriasis, GERD, and allergic rhinitis.  Of note, in his history, his father also had tuberculosis. 


SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a bus driver for senior housing in the past.  He reports drinking approximately two drinks monthly and has not smoked for many years. 


ALLERGIES:  He is lactose intolerant and has allergy to penicillin, which causes hives.  He also has environmental allergies. 


He had hyperglycemia postoperatively but not at other times. 


CURRENT MEDICINES:  Lexapro 20 mg daily, Klor-Con 10 mEq daily, carvedilol 3.125 mg twice daily, warfarin 7.5-10 mg, Lasix 40 mg for one week, Seroquel 25 mg for one week to help him sleep at night, Senokot as needed, and Symbicort two puffs daily since March. 


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He has three cats at home, favorite activities are walking, dancing, and bowling.  His healthcare proxy is his wife.  His review of systems is positive also for occasional dizziness, frequent constipation, cough which has gotten worse as the breathing gets worse, occasional difficulty with urination, and some heat or cold intolerance.  He was hospitalized for psychiatric diagnosis at the age of 16, never since.  His review of systems is otherwise negative. 


He describes himself in his personal symptom questionnaire as sitting up to breathe three to more times weekly, monitoring his salt intake, not his fluid intake, being at approximately 25 on a scale of 0-100 with 100 being no problems with breathlessness.  His degree of fatigue was some at a 10 energy level with 100 being never tired.  He feels his heart failure is the biggest problem in his life. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He looks relatively cheerful but has some evidence of chronic illness.  His blood pressure is 120/88 in his left arm and 124/78 in his right arm.  His distal pulses are full in his feet, carotids are 2+ and quite bounding, with no bruits.  His cardiac exam reveals a displaced left ventricular impulse with prominent third heart sound, prominently split second heart sound.  He has a 1-1/2 out of 6 murmur of mitral regurgitation and a 1/6 murmur of aortic regurgitation.  His abdomen shows evidence of ascites.  He has marked tenderness over the hepatic area without a palpable edge.  His chest is clear to auscultation and percussion.  His jugular venous pressure is approximately 14 cm.  His extremities have a trace of edema and are lukewarm.  His strength is grossly normal in four extremities.  His palate is high.  He has no obvious corneal opacities or lens displacement.  His eyes are without jaundice or arcus.  His skin is without rashes or sores.  His strength is 4/4 and he is oriented x3. 


His echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction in the range of 20% with a small amount of aortic regurgitation and marked dyssynchrony with the right ventricle coming in, well before the left ventricle. 


Electrocardiogram shows a QRS duration approximately 174 with a right bundle-branch pattern and inferior infarction that is chronic. 


ASSESSMENT: 

1.  Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction most likely highly related to progressive LV compromise prior to the original valve replacement.  The perioperative myocardial infarction likely decreased his function further.  His initial improvement after surgery with subsequent decline is typical of patients who undergo a late mitral valve surgery.  It is unclear the degree of which aortic regurgitation may be contributing to his left ventricular volume overload at this time. 

2.  Current hemodynamic status suggests markedly elevated right and left-sided filling pressures.  His cardiac output does not appear to be severely reduced, although was likely below normal.  He has no cardiac reserve at all and is currently class IV. 

3.  Related risks:  He is already on Coumadin for anticoagulation for his valve disease.  This is also for his anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, as his valve is not mechanical.  He needs to be considered for an implantable defibrillator as it is unlikely that he will have major improvement in his current ejection fraction regardless to subsequent therapy. 

4.  Potential for major intervention at this time, there is no obvious reversible lesion.  His aortic insufficiency might be greater than currently appreciated in which case repeat surgery could be contemplated.  However, it seems likely that he will need to be evaluated for cardiac transplantation. 


Current plan is to institute intravenous diuretics and evaluation of his current cardiac status with regard to potential for further therapy and prognosis.

Boston, MA 02115 

Dear Dr. Polk, 


I saw your patient, Robert Diehl, in the arrhythmia clinic today with Dr. Tedrow.  He was referred for consideration of upgrade to CRT in the setting of RV pacing and low left ventricular systolic ejection fraction. 


He is a 71 year old gentleman with multiple baseline comorbidities including moderately severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease and left ventricular systolic dysfunction of unclear etiology.  He was doing well until approximately April of 2014.  At that point he developed significant limiting dyspnea with exertion.  This prompted an admission to the VA Hospital in West Roxbury at which time an echocardiogram showed new onset left ventricular systolic dysfunction.  Interestingly he denied any orthopnea, PND or edema at that time.  He want onto have a cardiac catheterization and ultimately a PCI to his Left Circumflex coronary artery.  Post revascularization, however, he noted no significant improvement in his symptom burden. He continued to have limiting dyspnea despite addition of nocturnal home oxygen.  Over the past several weeks, however, he notes a return to his baseline state with no clear intervention.  He can now walk up to three blocks without stopping due to dyspnea.  Similarly, he can climb one flight of stairs.  There has also been marked improvement in his lower extremity edema. 


He denies any recent orthopnea or paroxysmal dyspnea.  There has been no syncope since his pacemaker implantation in approximately 2011.  He denies any history of palpitations. 


Past Medical History: 

1. Severe pulmonary hypertension with PASP of ~ 70 mmHg 

2. CAD with PCI to LCx in May 2014 

3. Aortic Stenosis (moderately severe) 

4. Hypertension 

5. Dyslipidemia 

6.  Neck Surgery post L4/L5 fracture with fusion 

7. Diabetes 

8. Total knee replacement (left) 

9. COPD on nocturnal home oxygen 

10. Tonsillectomy 

12. Cholecystectomy 


Medications:
1. Plavix 75 mg po daily 

2. Aspirin 81 mg po daily 

3. Atorvastatin 80 mg po daily 

4. Glyburide 5 mg po BID 

5. Lisinopril 2.5 mg po daily 

6. Metformin 500 mg po BID 

7. Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg po BID 

8. Neurontin 300 mg po BID 

9. Symbicort 160/4.6 two puffs BID 

10. Spiriva 18 mcg inhaled daily 


Allergies: Zaroxolyn (hypnatremia) 


SHx: He is retired from the Navy.  He quitsmoking 3-4 years ago and has a 100 pack year smoking history.  He does not drink alcohol and he denies the use of recreational drugs. 


Family History: 

There is no family history of early coronary artery disease or sudden cardiac death.  His brother required valve replacement at the age of 35 but survived until his 70s. 


Physical Examination:  BP 104/66, P 88, Ht 63.25 in, Wt 181 lb, BMI 31.8.  Equal, decreased breath sounds throughout both lung fields.  No adventitious sounds.  Normal S1.  Single S2.  No S3 or S4.  Mid to late peaking systolic ejection murmur, loudest at the base with radiation to the carotids. Mild pretibial edema bilaterally. 


ECG:  Atrial sensed, ventricular paced rhythm.  Paced QRS duration approximately 160 msec. 


Dobutamine Stress Echo: At rest, LVEF 25-30% with global hypokinesis.  Moderate aortic stenosis. With stress, left ventricular EF is 30-35% with mean gradient of 32.7 mmHg and a peak AV gradient of 51.6 mmHg.  


Device Interrogation: 

DDDR with lower rate of 60, upper tracking rate of 130 per minute.  P wave 4 - 5.6 mV.  R wave not measured due to ventricular pacing.  Atrial lead impedance 455 ohms.  Ventricular lead impedance 449 ohms.  Atrial threshold was 0.5 V @ 0.4 ms and ventricular threshold was 0.5 V @ 0.4 ms. 


Impression/Plan: 

This is a 71 year old gentleman with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, severe pulmonary hypertension and limiting dyspnea at a functional class II-III capacity.  His symptom burden, however, has improved significantly over the past several weeks.  The potential risks and benefits of ICD implantation were discussed with him.  He does not wish ICD implantation.  The potential risks and benefits of CRT were discussed with him as well.  He is interested in proceeding given the possiblity of improvements in his quality of life, but given his significant symptomatic improvement over the past several weeks, he would like to weigh his options before deciding whether or not to proceed with CRT-P upgrade.  He will contact the office should he wish to proceed. 


Sincerely,

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea. 


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old gentleman with a history of cardiomyopathy, status post left circumflex stenting on 05/05/14 and moderate aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension and COPD.  We met Mr. Diehl last week and at that time his chief complaint was dyspnea with unclear etiology of why his ejection fraction is worse.  It sounds as though he may have had a viral illness earlier in the winter in January or February and started noticing worsening shortness of breath after that.  He underwent a stress echo with minimal augmentation of his LV and moderate aortic stenosis. 


Since last week, he is actually feeling pretty well.  He has some good days when his dyspnea is much improved.  He did note some leg cramps and his primary care physician had him obtain laboratory values.  Dr. Kelliher obtained some labs and he was noted to be hyperkalemic and his potassium was discontinued.  


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   

1.  Cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology. 

2.  Coronary artery disease status post stenting of his circumflex 05/2014. 

3.  Complete heart block status post permanent pacemaker in 2011. 

4.  Hypertension. 

5.  COPD. 

6.  Cervical and back discomfort status post arthroplasty of his neck as well as multiple back surgeries in the 80s and 90s. 

7.  Pulmonary hypertension. 

8.  Asbestos exposure. 

9.  Diabetes. 


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Permanent pacemaker as noted above, cervical fusion in 1960s, multiple back surgeries in the 80s and 90s, cholecystectomy and TA in 1960. 


MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81, atorvastatin 80, glyburide 5 mg b.i.d., Klor-Con 20 mEq b.i.d. (recently held), metformin 500 b.i.d., metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg b.i.d., Neurontin 300 b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg daily, Symbicort 160/4.5 recently restarted amitriptyline 50 and lisinopril 2.5, Vicodin nightly p.r.n. and Tylenol 650 p.r.n. 


ALLERGIES:  Zaroxolyn which causes hyponatremia.  


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure today is 110/71 and heart rate is 84.  HEENT is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck is supple without adenopathy.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Conjunctivae JVP is at about 8 cm.  Lungs are distant, but clear.  Heart has a 1-2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and extremities with trace to 1+ edema. 


EKG shows atrial sensed ventricular paced rhythm.   


His most recent labs on 07/28/14 show a potassium of 5.8, creatinine 0.84.  AST is 51 and ALT is 46. 


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 71-year-old gentleman with cardiomyopathy, which appears out of proportion to either his moderate AF or his left circumflex disease and may very well be post-viral in nature.  His dyspnea is likely multifactorial including his COPD and pulmonary hypertension as well as his cardiomyopathy.  He underwent dobutamine stress echo to see if his LV augmented and if his AF worsened.  He had minimal augmentation of his LV and with no significant change in the gradients of his aortic valve. 


On exam today, he looks much more comfortable.  His edema in his lower extremities, this improved.  I have elected to keep him on the same dose of Lasix.  I think he has not taken this several times last week because of appointments and he was significantly volume overloaded. 


We talked about potential interventions at this point, I do not think intervening on his valves is warranted.  We did talk about the potential upgrade to a BiV ICD given that his EF has not improved over the last several months despite the treatment with the ACE and beta-blockers he has tolerated.  I will also try to review and see if he has had a right heart catheterization when he underwent his PCI.  He is scheduled to see his pulmonologist tomorrow and I told him we would discuss.  We will talk again early next week.

DIEHL, ROBERT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea. 


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old gentleman who had been doing fairly well until several months ago when he had progressive shortness of breath and was noted to have a significant drop in his ejection fraction from the 50s to the 20s and then underwent further evaluation and was found to have obstructive coronary disease in his left circumflex.  He underwent stenting of this on 05/05/14 where he underwent overlapping drug-eluting stents (Resolute 3.0 x 30 and 3.0 x 15) on proximal mid circumflex lesions.  He was discharged and says that he has progressively gotten more short of breath and does not feel like his functional status is improved.  He comes now seeking help with his dyspnea. 


His past medical history is significant as for asbestos exposure and history of COPD for which she is being treated with inhalers at this time.  In looking through his records, he does have mild-to-moderate MR, a degree of transmitral gradient with a mean gradient in the 7s as well as potentially at least moderate aortic stenosis.  He also is notable for significant pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary pressures in the 60s. 


He denies any chest discomfort, PND, or orthopnea.  He denies any syncope or presyncope.  He was recently seen in the emergency room for myoclonic changes and this was felt to be secondary to hyponatremia because of recent initiation of metolazone to his regimen. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 

1.  Cardiomyopathy. 

2.  Coronary artery disease status post PCI x2 of the circumflex in 05/2014. 

3.  Complete heart block status post permanent pacemaker in 2011. 

4.  History of hypertension. 

5.  COPD. 

6.  Cervical and back discomfort status post arthroplasty of his neck as well as multiple back surgeries in the 1980s and 1990s. 

7.  Asbestos exposure. 


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   

1.  Permanent pacemaker as noted above. 

2.  Cervical fusion in the 196y0s. 

3./  Multiple back surgeries in the 1980s and 1990s. 

4.  Cholecystectomy. 

5.  Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in 1960. 


MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81, atorvastatin 80, glyburide 5 mg b.i.d., Klor-Con 20 mEq b.i.d., metformin 500 b.i.d., metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg b.i.d., Neurontin 300 b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg daily, Symbicort 160/4.5 one puff b.i.d.  Recently stopped amitriptyline, Zaroxolyn, Tegretol, lisinopril and Lopid. 


ALLERGIES:  Zaroxolyn which caused hyponatremia. 


SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife June who has a private nurse at Partners.  He quit smoking after a significant at least 80-pack-year history.  Does not drink for over 20 years.  He worked in the Navy and had a significant exposure to asbestos. 


FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for mother who died of coronary disease age 65.  He has 2 siblings with cancer and one with heart problems. 


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for fatigue and shortness of breath, which seems to be worsening over the last 2 months.  He denies any GI or GU symptoms.  He does have some lower extremity edema today as he does not take his Lasix because he was traveling in for his visit. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 116/70.  HEENT is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck is supple without adenopathy.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Conjunctivae are pink, sclerae nonicteric.  Lungs were clear, diminished at the bases, but clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart has a 2/6 mid peaking systolic ejection murmur.  There is soft 1-2 holosystolic murmur heard at the left lower sternal border.  Extremities with 1+ pitting edema to his mid shins.   

EKG shows atrial sensed and ventricular paced rhythm at a rate of 97. 


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 71-year-old gentleman with new onset cardiomyopathy who underwent PCI of his left circumflex approximately 2-1/2 months ago.  He continues to have significant symptoms of dyspnea.  This may be multifactorial given his underlying cardiomyopathy which seems out of proportion, to the extent of coronary disease.  He does have valvular issues and even though he has had several echocardiograms, I would like him to undergo echocardiogram today so that we can get a better assessment of his aortic and mitral valves.  He also has significant pulmonary hypertension by previous exams and this too is likely multifactorial.  For now, we will put him back on a little bit of his lisinopril, which had been stopped for hypotension in the setting of that and Zaroxolyn.  We will have him undergo an echocardiogram today and then consider next steps based on the results.  I would like to see if his EF has improved at all status post his PCI.  I will talk with him after his echocardiogram.

Consult Requested by: Emergency Department 

Consult Requested for: ? partial seizure 


HPI: 71 yo M with HTN, CHF with EF 20%, CHB s/p ppm, s/p cardiac stent at Worcester, presenting with gait instability and muscle jerking. Starting yesterday he had trouble standing because his legs "kept giving out." Not particularly worse in one leg vs the other. He ended up falling early in the morning and hit his head, though believes it may have been related to knee pain rather than legs buckling. In the meantime his family has also noted that he has started having intermittent jerking movement throughout his body, occuring spontaneously, often in hands/arms, at times in legs. No particularly side. Always awake and alert during the jerking events.  


CHF was noted at time of recent MI with stent placement and has since been undergoing diuresis. Lasix was recently increased and a couple of days ago metolazone was added onto his regimen. PCP found K to be low a couple of days ago so added potassium pills. Found to have low Na of 122 upon admission here. No other recent med changes. Has never had jerking movements like this in past. No history of cardiac arrest or major cardiac surgery. Had knee replaced 2 years ago and pacemaker placed approx 5 years ago. No prior stroke history.

Assessment/Plan: 71 yo man with HTN, CHF, CAD s/p stent placement presenting with new onset myoclonus which is limiting his ability to walk. Other than these extra movement, exam is non-focal. Etiology of myoclonus likely secondary to metabolic or medication effect though specific trigger unclear. It is noteworthy that symptoms started with initiation of metolazone, which also caused metabolic abnormalities. No history of liver dysfunction or anoxic brain insult. 


- Admit to Neuro, attending Lyons 

- Check LFTs, ammonia, correct electrolytes 

- Review current meds for side effect of myoclonus  

- Consider treatment with clonazepam if no obvious trigger found 

- Consider CT head + contrast (though unlikely central cause) 

- Consider EEG, though does not appear to be epileptic myoclonus

Admission to DMD 


I agree with the above note from my colleague, Dr. Miller.  Please refer to her note for details on presentation.   In summary, Mir Diehl is a 71 yo with new onset of myoclonus and falls at home.  He has multiple medical problems, including HTN, CHF and CAD, but no hystory of liver or renal disease.  Recent intiation of metalozone.   Other than the myoclonic movements, his neuro exam is normal.  His labs show a severe hyponatremia, elevated BMP and liver enzymes.  His neuroimaging (CT) was non-revealing.  


No history of postanoxic encephalopathy, no evidence of cortical stroke.  No signs of meningo-encephalitis. Other rare infective causes include HIV, West Nile and JC virus, Whipple's disease.  Lack of any cognitive impairment, rules out CreutzfeldtJakob disease.  Exposure to drugs or toxins is a possibility and we will send for U and Serum tox evaluation. Metabolic and toxic encephalopathies are often accompanied by myoclonus. These include renal failure, liver failure and endocrinopathies (dysthyroid state, diabetes mellitus). Other systemic abnormalities include electrolyte (sodium or calcium), pH disturbances (alkalosis), hypercapnia and hypoxaemia. Clonazepam, sodium valproate, levetiracetam or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)may improve myoclonus. 


Plan 

# Admission 

# Labs: check urine lytes and osm; check TSH, A1C, Ammonia, Follow LFTs,  

# If does not improve with slow NA correction, will need and LP 

#PT/ OT eval 

# Fall precaution 

# Hold diuretics 

# Will hold Carbamazepine for the hyponatremia

 Reason for visit:
 ? Indication for CRT / ICD

 Interval History:
 Primary cardiologist: Mark Weinfeld, NWH

Patient presented with exertional chest discomfort at a low level of activity in early 2014 with subsequent vasodilator MPI study notable for largely fixed anterior infarct with some ischemia and EF 37%.

Preoperative TTE in 2/28/2014: LV high normal in size (5.4 cm) with EF 35-40% with anteroseptal akinesis and apical lateral segment and apical anterior segment HK.

3/11/2014 Coronary angiogram: LM 40% ostial and distal disease, LAD 95% proximal and occluded in mid-vessel, distal LAD fills via to R to L collaterals. LCX diffuse 50% proximal disease, occluded in mid-vessel, OM1 occluded and collateralized and fills L to L and R to L, RCA dominant with 30% proximal diseae, PDA 70% mid-vesseld diseae, PLV 75% mid-vessel disease.

4/17/2014 CABG: LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM2 to PDA (Melnitchouk) tolerated procedure well.

6/25/2014 ETT: 1:00 on standard Bruce protocol, HR 100 -> 126, 2.8 METS, stable LBBB.

Most recent noninvasive TTE assessment was at NWH on 8/13/2014:
LV borderline enlarged, 5.3 cm, EF 30%. The mid and distal lateral wall, entire anterior septum, basal lateral segment, and apical inferior segment are hypokinetic. Mild LAE. Posterior MAC with moderate MR. Trace TR.

Of note, although he no longer exeriences angina, his DOE has largely persisted, still able to walk only about 150 yards before experiencing dyspnea. He subsequently saw Dr. Moussa Mansour on 9/3/2014 with consideration for possible CRT-D implantation and was started on low dose lisinopril.

In late September, patient had a syncopal episode where he was feeling in his USOH until after dinner and had acute onset of diaphoresis and lightheadedness/presyncope while seated. He was concerned he may be having a repeat heart attack and took SL NG x2 (taken rarely in the past) and ultimately lost consciousness. He has been fully back to baseline and was in sinus LBBB at time of EMS arrival. While being monitored at NWH, he had short salvos of NSVT that were asymptomatic (reportedly three).

This included 9/28/2014 at 5:03 PM: 12b NSVT inferoposteriorly directed (+ in II/III, negative in V1 with left bundloid pattern) largely monomorphic. Additional run with similar morphology noted on telemetry.

He reportedly had three NSVT events on telemetry during subsequent monitoring with rates up to 200 bpm (asymptomatic). TnT 0.05 -> 0.04 at that time with normal electrolytes at time of presentation.

9/28/2014 EKG: SR @ 74 with PR 210. LAE. LBBB (QRS 158) and associated repolarization abnormalities.

CONTACT: (617) 244-5982 

CODE STATUS: FULL (presumed) 


REASON FOR ADMISSION:  AICD Implantation 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  


Mr. Stewart is a 78 year old male withhx of CAD s/p CABG in April 2014, iCMP with prior EF 30%, hyperlipidemia, CKD, and DVT on coumadin who initially presented to the NWH ED after a syncopal episode on 9/27/14.  

He reports having sudden onset of dizziness, nausea  and diaphoresis while at sitting on the couch. He did not have any chest pain or discomfort. However he took SL nitro, and subsequently lost consciousness for few minutes. EMS was called and he woke up and did not have any postictal symptoms.  


At NWH, Dr Dweik (cardiologist) was consulted and his syncope was thought to be potentially due to a ventricular arrhythmia (vs hypotension from SL nitro). The former was more concerning since he had multiple episodes of asyumptomatic VT on telemetry during his four day hospital stay at NWH before transfer, and since also he had the symptoms prior to taking the nitro.   


The patient attends cardiac rehav 2x a week at NWH, and during a bicycle session few weeks ago he also was found to have VT on the monitor, which subsequently triggered a referral to Dr. Moussa who saw him on 9/3/14 and recommended implantation for a AICD, and was started on lisinopril.  


During the NWH stay, Troponins were cycled x 3  flat at 0.05, 0.04, 0.04, which is reduced from recent trops from  

May 2014 at 0.19. His INR was 2.5 on admission and was held on the evening of 9/29/14 in preparation of AICD placement.

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncope and dizziness.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old gentleman with a

past medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy status post CABG this

year, history of hyperlipidemia, carotid stenosis, history of chronic

renal insufficiency, history of DVTs, B cell lymphoma, history of

neuropathy, history of TURP, who saw his cardiologist on 09/17/14 at

which point, he was initiated on low-dose lisinopril at 2.5 mg.  He

was told that if he feels dizzy to stop the medicine.  The patient

felt fine until tonight when he was sitting at home with his wife and

daughter talking and suddenly started feeling dizzy.  He decided to

take nitro since he was not exactly sure whether for what reason to

take it.  He took 2 nitro and after that passed out.  He woke up when

the ambulance arrived, his blood pressure was systolic in the 50s.  He

got 250 mL of normal saline en route to the hospital with improvement

of blood pressure.  The patient said that he felt okay otherwise,

prior to this episode.  He denied having any headaches, dizziness, or

palpitations before.  Denied any cold or cough or feeling sick.  He

denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Denied having any

abdominal symptoms, denies any urinary symptoms, any weakness.  He

does have baseline numbness from his neuropathy and he does get wheezy

when he walks a lot.  As a note, he did take his lisinopril today, but

to get early in the morning as usual.  A similar episode never

happened to him in the past.  When he presented to the Emergency Room,

his temperature was 98.5, pulse 65, blood pressure 107/64, respiratory

rate 18.  He is saturating 100% on room air.  His orthostatics were

negative by blood pressure, but his pulse change from 65 to 87.  His

workup was noted for slightly elevated troponin 0.05, close to his

baseline.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative other than mentioned above.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

1.  Hyperlipidemia.

2.  History of CABG in April 2014, history of ischemic cardiomyopathy.

 Echo around 35% to 40%.  He is being considered for defibrillator.

3.  History of carotid stenosis.

4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.

5.  History of 2 DVTs.

6.  History of B cell lymphoma.

7.  History of chronic lower extremity neuropathy.

8.  History of glaucoma.

9.  History of cholecystectomy.

10.  History of 2 back surgeries.

11.  History of TURP, now has a Foley bag attached.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  He lives with his wife.  He

has 4 children and 3 grandchildren.  He used to do airport business. 

He quit smoking many years ago, no alcohol and no drugs.


FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.


ALLERGIES:  OPIOIDS and CODEINE.  Codeine causes feeling weak and

nausea many years ago.


MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

1.  Baby aspirin daily.

2.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily.

3.  Travatan 0.004% at night to each eye.

9.  Vitamin D3, 2000 units daily.

10.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.5, pulse 64, blood pressure

104/65, respiratory rate 18, satting 99% on room air.  In general,

pleasant gentleman in no acute distress, appears well.  HEENT:  Pupils

equal, reactive to light.  Normal oropharynx.  No jaundice.  No JVD,

no bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart: 

Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, distant heart sounds.  No

murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds

present.  Extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Pulses

2+.  Neurologic exam is grossly intact.


LABORATORIES:  White cell count 9.2, hemoglobin 12.4, hematocrit 37,

platelets 171.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 106, bicarbonate

22, BUN 26, creatinine 1.46, glucose 140.  LFTs within normal limits. 

LDL 47.  Lipase and amylase within normal limits.  Troponin 0.05. 

Chest x-ray shows no acute findings.  EKG shows left bundle-branch

block.  Compared to prior EKG, T waves are flipped in V5 and V6.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 78-year-old gentleman with a past

medical history of hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease status post

coronary artery bypass graft, ischemic cardiomyopathy, deep venous

thromboses, chronic renal insufficiency, carotid stenosis, B cell

lymphoma, neuropathy who presents with syncope.


1.  Syncope.  The patient took nitro and syncopized.  The syncope most

likely explained by the nitro, which dropped his pressure

significantly; however, it is hard to figure out why the patient

became dizzy.  It sounds like he started lisinopril more than a week

ago, so unclear why it suddenly caused symptoms today, although it

could definitely be an accumulative effect.  Another concern would be

with his cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia that caused him to become

lightheaded and syncopized.  The patient also has a history of carotid

stenosis with a right ICA occlusion; however, it would be hard to

hypothesis how he would syncopize just from 1 sided carotid occlusion.

 In terms of plan, I think we will put him on telemetry monitoring and

rule him out for myocardial infarction.  His troponin is slightly

elevated, but that is more or less baseline for him and could be due

to his renal insufficiency, I think it worthwhile consulting with his

cardiologist regarding further plan of action.  He was considered for

defibrillator before and this might be the time to proceed with that. 

Will hold his lisinopril for now.  We will also hold his carvedilol

since he is orthostatic by pulse and will monitor him overnight and

restart his carvedilol if he is improved.  I am not going to give him

any fluids because he does not seem to be dehydrated, especially given

his ischemic cardiomyopathy, but just observe him tonight.

2.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  Creatinine is at baseline.

3.  Mild anemia.  His hematocrit is at baseline.

4.  History of gout.  Continue allopurinol.

5.  History of glaucoma.  Continue eyedrops.

6.  History of DVT.  We will continue him on Coumadin and check INR.

7.  Hyperlipidemia.  We will continue Lipitor.

8.  Prophylaxis.  He is on Coumadin.


CODE STATUS:  Full, confirmed with the patient.

CONSULTATION          

DATE OF CONSULTATION:09/29/2014

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Dr. Emily Collier


REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Syncope, ventricular tachycardia.


HISTORY:  This is a very pleasant 78-year-old white male with known

history of CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and hyperlipidemia:  The

patient has known history of anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction

and recently underwent coronary artery bypass surgery on 04/17/14. 

The patient in rehabilitation was noted to have a ventricular

arrhythmia and had an EP consultation earlier this month.  He was

asymptomatic and decision was made to continue with clinical

observation with plans for possible defibrillator.


The patient over the weekend was sitting at home with his family when

he started to feel dizzy.  He immediately reached to his nitroglycerin

and took a couple of nitroglycerin.  Soon after the patient started to

become very clammy and had loss of consciousness.  His wife witnessed

the event and according to her, he appeared to be very pale.  The

patient was out for a couple of minutes and the EMTs were called.  On

arrival, the patient was awake and alert and he was transported to our

hospital.  The patient was admitted and maintained on telemetry on his

usual home medications.  His troponin levels were slightly abnormal,

but flat.  The patients electrolytes were normal.  Meanwhile, on

telemetry, he had 3 events of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia

with rates up to 200 beats a minute that were totally asymptomatic.  I

was asked to assess the patient for further management.


The patient, as mentioned, had coronary artery bypass surgery in April

and recently in August had a repeat echocardiogram to assess his

ejection fraction.  The patients echocardiogram done on 08/13/14

revealed an ejection fraction of 30%, with hypokinesis of the mid to

distal lateral wall, entire anterior septum, basolateral wall and

inferior apex.  He also had moderate mitral regurgitation.


The patient clinically has been feeling well until his present

admission.  He denies any recent episodes of chest pain or chest

discomfort.  He denies any palpitations, dizziness, or prior syncope. 

He denies any shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, or pedal edema.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per present history, otherwise, unremarkable in

detail.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

1.  CAD status post CABG 04/17/04 with LIMA graft to the LAD, vein

graft to the second marginal branch and to the PDA.

2.  History of ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 30%.

3.  Moderate mitral regurgitation.

4.  History of DVT on chronic anticoagulation.

5.  History of carotid disease.

6.  History of lymphoma.

7.  History of hyperlipidemia.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post coronary artery bypass surgery and

status post cholecystectomy.


MEDICATIONS:

1.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg b.i.d.

2.  Atorvastatin 40 mg daily.

3.  Aspirin 81 mg daily.

4.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg daily.

5.  Warfarin.


ALLERGIES:  CODEINE.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives with his wife.  He

has 4 children.  The patient is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol

socially.


FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Alert, oriented, in no apparent distress. 

Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 110/70, pulse 78 and regular,

respirations 18, temperature 98.  ENT:  Clear.  Neck:  No jugular

venous distention.  The carotids were 1+ bilaterally with no audible

bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation and percussion. 

Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2, no S3, S4, no rubs or murmurs. 

Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, good bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No

cyanosis, clubbing or edema and dorsalis pedis pulses were 1+

bilaterally.


LABORATORY WORK:  Sodium 138, potassium 4.6, BUN 23, creatinine 1.4. 

Hematocrit 38.8.  INR 2.5.


IMPRESSION:  This is a 78-year-old white male who is status post

coronary artery bypass graft 5 months ago for a silent myocardial

infarction with cardiomyopathy who recently had an echocardiogram in

August with an ejection fraction of 30%.  He presents with a syncopal

event and has ruled out for myocardial infarction.  Meanwhile, on

telemetry, he had short runs of ventricular tachycardia that were

asymptomatic.


Reviewing the patients records and telemetry, I feel that the patient

is a candidate for an AICD implantation.  I did contact Dr. Mansour at

MGH who accepted the patient in transfer.  His warfarin will be held

at this time while continuing his other medication as usual.


The case was discussed with the medical team.

Echocardiogram  

08/13/2014: Normal left ventricular cavity size. Anterior, lateral, and apical inferior hypokinesis. Moderately decreased left ventricular systolic function, LVEF 30%. Normal right ventricular size and function. Mild left atrial enlargement. Moderate mitral regurgitation.  A prior study was performed on 05/13/2014. Compared to the previous report, no significant change. (On personal review, transmitral Doppler pattern of restrictive. Normal inferior vena cava size and respiratory variation.) 


I called the patient and reported these results, with no late improvement in left ventricular systolic function.  I recommended the following plan: 

1.  EP consultation concerning possible ICD as scheduled (The patient states he has an appointment in 3 weeks) 

2.  Follow up with me as scheduled

The patient had a cardiac rehabilitation on 8/4/2014 an 11-beat run of a wide-complex tachycardia after exercise. Although there was some irregularity at the start of the arrhythmia, there was an increase in rate with regularity towards the end of the arrhythmia and evidence of A-V dissociation early in the arrhythmia run, most consistent with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. 


I called the patient and reviewed the issue of his arrhythmia and his ischemic cardiomyopathy. He is doing well. I recommended the following plan:
1. Continuation of carvedilol
2. Continuation of exercise in cardiac rehabilitation
3. Echocardiogram to reassess left ventricular systolic function
4. Electrophysiology consultation concerning possible ICD placement 


The patient agrees with this approach.

Dear Jim: 


I had the pleasure of meeting this 57-year-old professor of genetics at UMass Amherst who originally presented with shortness of breath and syncope in 2011 and was found to be in 2:1 AV block.  He underwent placement of a Medtronic dual-chamber pacemaker.  He did well, afterwards, but noted gradual deterioration in his exercise capacity over the past year and particularly in the past 6 months. Currently, he is in an NYHA class III level with any level of more than mild exertion causing shortness of breath.  Uphill walking is difficult and one flight of stairs brings on dyspnea.  He has no nocturnal dyspnea or peripheral edema and he has not had any orthopnea. 


At the time of original presentation with complete heart block, an echocardiogram had shown mild LV dysfunction with an ejection fraction recorded as 45%.  There is no evidence for myocardial ischemia at that time by stress tesging with perfusion imaging study. 


More recent cardiac evaluation has shown that his ejection fraction has dropped dramatically, recorded as 15%.  He underwent cardiac catheterization on 03/12/14 of this year and this showed no evidence for obstructive coronary artery disease.  Cardiac output was measured at 2.6 L per minute using the thermodilution method.  Pulmonary artery pressure was 33/13, wedge pressure was 15/13 with a mean of 12 and right atrial pressure mean was 8.  Left ventricular ejection fraction calculated from the left ventricular angiography was 15% with global hypokinesis. 


Of note, there was no mention of any valvular abnormalities on his echocardiography or left ventricular angiography. 


The patient has no other symptoms.  In particular, there have been no syncopal events.  His past medical history is remarkable for a history of gout for which he takes allopurinol 300 mg daily.  He was recently commenced on lisinopril 5 mg and Coreg 3.125 mg b.i.d., but he has rather low blood pressure making it difficult to escalate the doses of these drugs. 


He has no known drug allergies although more recently, approximately a week after his cardiac catheterization, he developed a rash which is dissipating at the present time. 


In his family history, his mother died at age of 84 from complications related to shingles and dementia.  His father died at age of 72 from complications of cardiac surgery.  He was a diabetic.  His brother, age 59, and a sister age 54, both of who are alive and well.  There is no family history of cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac death. 


He is a nonsmoker, drinks no alcohol. 


Today's clinical examination revealed him to be well appearing without lymphadenopathy, anemia or jaundice.  Peripheral pulses are equal bilaterally.  He had warm peripheries and a blood pressure of 80/60 in the right arm seated.  He was in a regular, paced rhythm at 70 beats per minute.  Heart sounds were normal.  There was a probable third heart sound.  There were no cardiac murmurs.  Lung fields are clear.  Abdominal examination was negative and there were no gross neurologic abnormalities. 


Interrogation of his left pectoral pacemaker showed adequate sensing and pacing thresholds in both atrial and ventricular chambers.  He has no underlying rhythm to 30 beats per minute.  He has a Medtronic device in place with Medtronic atrial and ventricular leads. 


In conclusion, this 57-year-old gentleman who originally presented with complete AV block has now developed progressive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction with global hypokinesis.  Although dyssynchrony created by right ventricular pacing may have contributed to this deterioration, this level of rapid decline also suggests an underlying cardiomyopathy, in particular a genetic cardiomyopathies such as lamin A/C disease or inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis.  I will arrange for him to have a FDG PET CT imaging study to see if he has any evidence for an inflammatory processes.  I will also arrange for him to be admitted next week after his PET imaging study for upgrade of his pacemaker system to provide cardiac resynchronization therapy in the form of her defibrillator.  At that point, we may also consider a right ventricular biopsy to see if we can obtain some diagnostic information.  The hope is that with cardiac resynchronization therapy, we can stabilize his cardiac ejection fraction and obtain a level of improvement in his ejection fraction.  Once cardiac resynchronization  is implemented; we may also be able to increase his anti-heart failure medications.  I will also take the liberty of having the cardiomyopathies team at the BWH consult on him. 


I hope the above plans are in keeping with your thoughts.  I will, of course, get back in touch with you once I have further information. 


Many thanks again for letting me be involved in his care. 


With kindest regards. 


Yours sincerely,

 ADMISSION FOR CRT-D implantation

 Interval History:
 Ms. Noyes is a 63-year-old woman, with a history of long-standing (> 3 months) HF on optimal medical regimen with wide-QRS and declining LVEF awaiting CRT-D implantation. When we first saw her 3 months ago, , she has noticed dyspnea on exertion for over 3 months as well as increasing leg swelling in the last month as well. She denies any chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope. She was admitted to MVH and underwent diuresis wiht IV lasix. An echo on 03/07/2014,demonstrated an ejection fraction of 16%. RV was dilated and also diffusely hypokinetic as well with RV systolic pressure of 54. She continued to be diuresed with Lasix 20 mg IV b.i.d. with good diuresis. The patient was started on aspirin, on 03/10/2014. Lisinopril was started on 03/13/2014, 25 mg daily. She also received potassium 20 mEq on the 03/12/2014. On the 03/13/2014, it was noted that over the past 2 to 3 days, she had had some nonsustained episodes of wide-complex tachycardia. Less than 10 beats. She was asymptomatic. 

She currently continues to endorse shortness of breath with exertion but denies shortness of breath at rest. She denies any chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness. She denies any history of syncope. 

Her most LVEF is 26% with a dilated LV.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 Mrs. Noyes returns in followup of her dilated cardiomyopathy and her inverted psoriasis which had prevented her having an ICD implanted when she was at MGH.

 Interval History:
 Her skin has cleared entirely.

During the period when her skin was improving, her breathing has also improved and she feels much better than she did at the time of her M.G.H. hospitalization.

Her initial echocardiogram had an ejection fraction in the mid teens and a subsequent one in the 20s. It is possible that she may be spontaneously improving and before we go ahead with a device placement, she will have another echocardiogram.

She still doesn't do much walking but she has no dyspnea around the house and no orthopnea.

She has some painful feelings in her feet which are probably neuropathy related to her diabetes.

 Past medical history:
 Essentially nil other than diabetes discovered at the time of her hospitalization at MGH and possible diabetic neuropathy. She had not seen a physician in several decades.

Dear Dolph, 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Murphy in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic on 03/21/2008, soon after you saw him for a regular follow-up following his increasing episodes of congestive heart failure as well as three recent therapies by his ICD reported by the patient. 

As you know, Mr. Murphy had traveled to Florida on 02/08/2008. The patient tells me that he was not feeling well up to that point and he decided to go there in case that he felt better. His symptoms include extreme fatigue and progressive dyspnea on exertion to the point that it is hard to go up a flight of stairs. The initiation of Lasix by you had helped him. During his stay in Florida, he tried to be more active with daily walking and golfing. He did have an admission to a Maryland hospital on 02/09/2008 after he received three shocks. His ICD was interrogated there but there were no other measures taken. 

His ICD interrogation today shows that from 02/08-03/18/2008 the patient had 28 episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fast ventricular tachycardia which were treated with ATP (1 or 2 bursts). Within those were 5 diverted shocks after a failed ATP. There was an additional shock on 02/11/2008. All 4 shocks were after a failed ATP in the fast VT zone. The patient is A-paced/V-paced 98% of the time and he is pacemaker dependent. Of note, he has not had any significant recurrences of atrial fibrillation. 

His review of systems is also significant for gout exacerbation due to his therapy with Lasix. He took Indomethacin for it with good result in the past. He denies any chest pain, baseline shortness of breath, or significant leg edema. He denies any presyncope or syncope. 

His most recent cardiac evaluation includes an echocardiogram and a stress test performed at a Maryland hospital. Of note, the reported left ventricular ejection fraction was lower than our previous measurements here at 25%. His stress test was negative for ischemia with a fixed inferolateral defect.

 EKG:
 03/21/2008: Atrioventricular paced rhythm at 67 BPM. Frequent PVC's.

 Impression:
 Mr. Murphy is a 65 year old gentleman with a history of right ventricular dysplasia extending to the left side with recurrence of frequent episodes of ventricular tachycardia and increasing symptoms of congestive heart failure which would presently put him in a class III congestive heart failure. The patient is almost 100% ventricularly paced; ventricular activation which is equivalent to a left bundle branch block. He does not have any significant evidence of ischemia. He had a previous catheterization in 2002 that had shown no coronary artery disease. 

We had a long discussion with the patient regarding management options, addressing the two main issues in his case which include the ventricular tachycardia and the congestive heart failure. As the ventricular tachycardia may be a manifestation of the advancing congestive heart failure, I offered him the possibility of trying to address the heart failure first by upgrading his dual-chamber defibrillator to a biventricular device. His generator is, anyway, approaching ERI. If this measure does not abolish the frequent episodes of ventricular tachycardia, we will then consider him for a ventricular tachycardia ablation. His previous one was performed in 2005 and it was epicardial and successful. I would continue with the current medical management, titrating the dose of Lasix to his symptoms of congestive heart failure, as well as considering the addition of an ACE-inhibitor. 

I would like to thank you for allowing me to participate in Mr. Murphy's care. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any further questions. 

Sincerely yours, 

Theofanie Mela, M.D.

Chief Complaint: shortness of breath and shocks

History of Present Illness: He called me on 2/12/08 from Florida saying that he had been admitted to a hospital in Maryland because of three shocks on 2/9. He had the above evaluation. Of note was that he was short of breath for the shocks. I therefore told him to take Lasix 20 mg a day again. He subsequently got much better with less shortness of breath and no more shocks. However he still has increasing fatigability with exertion compared to a couple of months ago.

Social History: He owns and runs a contracting company (W. J. Murphy Construction). He is married and has eight children, five (age 32-23) by his first wife and 3 (age 12-9) by his present wife. 

Complete Cardiovascular Exam: Blood pressure 110/70. He has JVP of 5. He has no carotid bruits, no rales, no murmur, a normal S2 and no S3. His heart percusses about 2 cm beyond the MCL. He has a soft abdomen, a liver that palpates and percusses at 1cm, 2+ posterior tibial pulses. He has no edema.

EKG: AV pacing at 69 with P waves identified. Ventricular trigeminy common QRS .148 QTC .540.

Assessment: I had hoped at that some dilatation of the RV was leading to the shocks and therefore added the Lasix. Indeed he did get better after that and now his volume status is excellent. He will see Dr. Mela today and we will see what the interrogation shows. I wonder if it might be worth while another ablation attempt. Since the main problem is right ventricular I am not sure a biventricular pacer would help although his LVEF is also reduced at 36% by our echocardiogram last fall and perhaps lower at 20-30% by the data from Maryland. I will get a repeat MGH echocardiogram to reevaluate of the LV and the RV.

 Reason for visit:
 Upgrade to BiV

 Interval History:
 Mr. Gerard O'Brien was seen in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic on 12/17/2010 where he came for a follow up after his recent cardioversion and discovery of a low R-wave on his ICD interrogation. Mr. O'Brien is a 54 year old gentleman with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed in 2005 who received a single-chamber ICD on 03/02/2010 (Medtronic Secura VR). On 11/09/2010, the patient came to our lab for a scheduled cardioversion from persistent atrial fibrillation, which was successful. During that procedure, though, we recognized that the R-wave had decreased from 8 mV at the time of the procedure down to 2.6 mV. He, therefore, came back for further evaluation of the R-wave sensing by his ICD and consideration of a RV lead revision. In the meantime, the patient did feel significantly better with his conversion from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm, which he is still maintaining. Unfortunately, though, his congestive heart failure has really progressed to class III. At this point, he is quite fluid overloaded (15-20 pounds higher than his optimal weight) and he feels short of breath. He denies any orthopnea, PND, presyncope, syncope, or palpitations. 

ICD interrogation on 12/17 showed that the R-wave continues to be low at 2.6 mV. Of note, the OptiVol evaluation shows parameters beyond the abnormal level suggestive of exacerbation of congestive heart failure. The patient did have a chest x-ray on 11/09. That did not show any significantly different position of his RV lead.

 Past medical history:
 1) Dilated cardiomyopathy with a gradual progression over the years. His most recent echocardiogram on 10/28/2010 shows an EF of 26%, a left ventricular end diastolic diameter of 63 mm, a left atrial size of 48 mm, moderate mitral regurgitation, right ventricular systolic pressure of 47, mild hypokinesis of the right ventricle. 
2) Persistent atrial fibrillation S/P successful recent cardioversion 
3) Anxiety 
4) Barrett's esophagus 
5) Non-bleeding gastric ulcer in 07/2009 
6) Motor vehicle accident in 2008 with multiple rib fractures 
7) History of acute polyarthritis requiring the use of prednisone

 Social history:
 The patient is married. He is self-employed. He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day. He drinks 2-3 drinks per week.

Physical examination: 
-BMI: 34.3 Obese, high risk
-Pulse: 70 BPM regular
-height: 72 in.
-weight: 252.5 lbs.
-General: Middle-age gentleman in no apparent distress.
-Heent: unremarkable
-Neck: supple; JVD up to 9 cm; no carotid bruits; 2+ carotid pulses
-Chest: lungs: a few scattered rales 
-Cardiac: regular; normal S1/S2; no murmurs or gallops
-Abdomen: soft, nontender, without organomegaly
-Extremities: trace edema; 2+ distal pulses
-BP: 110/80 mmHg

 EKG:
 12/17/2010: Sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block at 220 msec, left bundle branch block with a QRS duration of 152 msec, and QTc of 470 msec.

 Impression:
 Mr. O'Brien is a 54 year old gentleman with dilated cardiomyopathy and progressively increasing congestive heart failure. He is at this point actually class III while he has developed a left bundle branch block aberrancy. The patient had atrial fibrillation from which he has been successfully cardioverted and he has been able to maintain sinus rhythm. At this point, the patient's ICD appears to be suboptimally functioning given the suboptimal sensing of an R-wave. I suspect that this is secondary to his LV dilatation from fluid overload but we still need to ascertain that there is a better placement of the RV lead at all times. At the same time, I think that the patient will benefit from an upgrade of his ICD to a CRT-D device.

We have talked in detail with him and his wife about the procedure and they are in agreement to proceed. Therefore, at the time of the right ventricular lead revision, we will add a right atrial and a left ventricular lead and upgrade his generator to a CRT-D.

 Reason for visit:
 Follow up for cardiomyopathy and CAD

 Interval History:
 This is a 54-year-old gentleman with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, mild coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation who presents for routine followup. He recently underwent DC cardioversion and remains in NSR. Since his last visit, he continues to struggle with his volume status, but he has had some improvement since being in NSR. He has required metolazone twice for symptoms of volume overload and increased weights. He reports awakening last night with a pounding sensation in his left chest that resolved spontaneously. no CP or SOB associated. He continues to have intermittent dyspnea on exertion. He has not had any hospitalizations or emergency room visit since his last visit. He remains on prednisone for severe gouty arthritis and has persistent hyperglycemia with glucose levels consistently near 200. I started him on glipizide 5mg daily 2 days ago for this and he is tolerating this well.

 Other Data:
 Device interrogation was performed today and I have reviewed the results. No AFib or other arrythmias and no device therapies noted. He had OptiVol fluid crossings in mid November through early December. 

 Assessment and plan:
 1. Cardiomyopathy. He is ACC/AHA stage C and New York Heart Association Class III. He is mildly volume overloaded today on exam. He will continue torsemide at 80mg PO BID and I have instructed him to take metolazone 2.5mg x1 tomorrow morning before his torsemide dose. He will also take an additional 40mEQ of potassium. He is scheduled for an upgrade of his device to CRT on Tuesday given his wide QRSd and persistent NYHA class III symptoms. He should continue Aldactone, enalapril and he is currently on sotalol. 

2. Coronary artery disease. Pharmacologic Nuclear stress test done 12/17/10 showed no evidence of ischemia and his LVEF is 33%. This certainly could be contributing to his symptoms and he has not had a recent stress test to follow up on his left anterior descending lesion. He should continue aspirin and simvastatin. 

3. Atrial fibrillation. He has maintained sinus rhythm on sotalol, status post DC cardioversion. He is currently on warfarin and is awaiting insurance approval for Pradaxa 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. He will transition to Pradaxa once he is able to obtain the medication. 

I have instructed him to discontinue his warfarin tomorrow in preparation for his procedure on Tuesday. I will see him while he is here for his procedure and in the office in three months.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

Dear Kim,

 I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient, Mr. Gerard O'Brien, in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic on 12/17/2010 where he came for a follow up after his recent cardioversion and discovery of a low R-wave on his ICD interrogation. As you know, Mr. O'Brien is a 54 year old gentleman with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed in 2005 who received a single-chamber ICD on 03/02/2010 (Medtronic Secura VR). On 11/09/2010, the patient came to our lab for a scheduled cardioversion from persistent atrial fibrillation, which was successful. During that procedure, though, we recognized that the R-wave had decreased from 8 mV at the time of the procedure down to 2.6 mV. He is, therefore, back here today for further evaluation of the R-wave sensing by his ICD and consideration of a RV lead revision. In the meantime, the patient did feel significantly better with his conversion from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm, which he is still maintaining. Unfortunately, though, his congestive heart failure has really progressed to class III. At this point, he is quite fluid overloaded (15-20 pounds higher than his optimal weight) and he feels short of breath. He denies any orthopnea, PND, presyncope, syncope, or palpitations. 

His ICD interrogation today shows that the R-wave continues to be low at 2.6 mV. Of note, the OptiVol evaluation shows parameters beyond the abnormal level suggestive of exacerbation of congestive heart failure. The patient did have a chest x-ray on 11/09. That did not show any significantly different position of his RV lead.

 Past medical history:
 1) Dilated cardiomyopathy with a gradual progression over the years. His most recent echocardiogram on 10/28/2010 shows an EF of 26%, a left ventricular end diastolic diameter of 63 mm, a left atrial size of 48 mm, moderate mitral regurgitation, right ventricular systolic pressure of 47, mild hypokinesis of the right ventricle. 
2) Persistent atrial fibrillation S/P successful recent cardioversion 
3) Anxiety 
4) Barrett's esophagus 
5) Non-bleeding gastric ulcer in 07/2009 
6) Motor vehicle accident in 2008 with multiple rib fractures 
7) History of acute polyarthritis requiring the use of prednisone

 Inactivated Allergies 
Aspirin - reaction: GI Intolerance (Blood in stool) [inactivated]

 Social history:
 The patient is married. He is self-employed. He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day. He drinks 2-3 drinks per week.

Physical examination: 
-BMI: 34.3 Obese, high risk
-Pulse: 70 BPM regular
-height: 72 in.
-weight: 252.5 lbs.
-General: Middle-age gentleman in no apparent distress.
-Heent: unremarkable
-Neck: supple; JVD up to 9 cm; no carotid bruits; 2+ carotid pulses
-Chest: lungs: a few scattered rales 
-Cardiac: regular; normal S1/S2; no murmurs or gallops
-Abdomen: soft, nontender, without organomegaly
-Extremities: trace edema; 2+ distal pulses
-BP: 110/80 mmHg

 EKG:
 12/17/2010: Sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block at 220 msec, left bundle branch block with a QRS duration of 152 msec, and QTc of 470 msec.

 Impression:
 Mr. O'Brien is a 54 year old gentleman with dilated cardiomyopathy and progressively increasing congestive heart failure. He is at this point actually class III while he has developed a left bundle branch block aberrancy. The patient had atrial fibrillation from which he has been successfully cardioverted and he has been able to maintain sinus rhythm. At this point, the patient's ICD appears to be suboptimally functioning given the suboptimal sensing of an R-wave. I suspect that this is secondary to his LV dilatation from fluid overload but we still need to ascertain that there is a better placement of the RV lead at all times. At the same time, I think that the patient will benefit from an upgrade of his ICD to a CRT-D device.

We have talked in detail with him and his wife about the procedure and they are in agreement to proceed. Therefore, at the time of the right ventricular lead revision, we will add a right atrial and a left ventricular lead and upgrade his generator to a CRT-D. In the meantime, he will increase his dose of diuretic intake starting today. I will contact Dr. Parks to further come in touch with him to give him guidance for his diuretic management. I will further see him when he comes for his procedure towards the end of January. 

I would like to thank you for allowing me to participate in his care. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any further questions. 

Sincerely yours, 

Theofanie Mela, M.D.

Patient: Gerard O'Brien 

MRN: 2090493 

DOV: 12/17/10 


CC:  F/u of gout, OA, bursitis 


HPI:  53 yo male initially presented early 8/09 with pain and swelling in both feet of approximately 2 weeks duration.  Then developed pain and swelling in elbows as well, which were aspirated and found to have intracellular MSU crystals.  Started on prednisone with good response.  Had flare again after taper, so was retreated with prednisone 20mg x 7 days, then planned taper down to 2.5mg daily for prophylaxis, in addition to colchicine 0.6mg daily (eGFR 60).   


9/23/09, he notes overall doing much better.  Knees and feet have resolved.  Still with occasional swelling in elbows.  Not with redness, warmth or pain.  Also occ. L wrist. 

- Injected b/l olecrenon bursae 

- Continue prednisone 5mg daily and colchicine 0.6mg daily for prophylaxis  

- Start allopurinol; will titrate 100mg daily x 2 weeks, then 200mg daily x 2 weeks, then 300mg daily 


12/23/09 - Called 12/20/09 noting shortness of breath, muscle pains, lower back pain, decreased urine, tightness in my head with exertion, groin-upper thigh pain-off and on, and significant fatigue.  Advised patient at that time to go to ED, which he did, and received lasix 40mg IV with no response.  Signed out AMA as was frustrated with no bed available. 

Today, he notes that he saw his PCP (Dr. Fifer) earlier, and is being admitted for CHF with 15 pound weight gain.  Fluid retention appears to be primarily in the abdomen.  He notes continued SOB/DOE and intermittent dry cough.  He does not note chest pain. 

No gout flares since last visit.  elbows responded well to injections. 


4/19/10:  Since last visit, has had two hospitalizations, both for heart failure.  Prior to the first hospitalization, stopped the allopurinol.  Restarted the allopurinol about 1 month ago, now at 200mg daily.  At the more recent  hospitalization in March, diagnosed by me with knee OA, and given knee injections.  Only had one week of relief with that injection.   

Today, he notes problems in the elbows and the knees.  There is swelling and pain.  With the swelling in the knees, there is also instability.  With the swelling in the knees, there is also warmth and redness.  With the elbows, there is not necessarily warmth, but there is redness.  The pain in the elbow is only when he leans on it.   He notes one bump in his L wrist and L ankle that is annoying, and hurt when he pushes on it.  The one on the wrist interferes with his watch. 


12/17/10:  Currently notes knees are an issue.  He notes pain, but not much swelling.  He notes crepitus.  The R is > L in the last 6 weeks.  The pain is constant, with no clear time of day.  He notes some new tenderness in his foot along his metatarsal heads, but it more of a slight parasthesia than a pain; it is in the same spot in both feet.  It is only along the 1st 3 toes, and not the 4th or 5th.  No redness, warmth or swelling.  He notes periodic swelling in his R elbow.  It will flare up 1-2x month, and last several days.  It is more of a nuisance than a real pain.

 Normal sinus rhythm with PVCs. There is a left axis deviation and a LAFB, prior anterolateral myocardial infarction, inferior Q waves as well, QRS duration 112 milliseconds, first-degree AV block.

 Impression:
 This is a 54-year-old gentleman with coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, status post DC cardioversion.

 Assessment and plan:
 1. Cardiomyopathy. He is ACC/AHA stage C and New York Heart Association Class III. Clinically, he is hypervolemic today. I have instructed him to increase his torsemide to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. Should he not have any reduction in his weight after 2-3 days or if his weight increases, I have instructed him to take metolazone 2.5 mg p.o. x1. He will have his electrolytes monitored in three to four days. He should continue Aldactone, enalapril and he is currently on sotalol.

2. Coronary artery disease. This certainly could be contributing to his symptoms and he has not had a recent stress test to follow up on his left anterior descending lesion. He has assured me he will have this done in the next few weeks. I will schedule him for an adenosine sestamibi stress test. He should continue aspirin and simvastatin.

3. Atrial fibrillation. He has maintained sinus rhythm on sotalol, status post DC cardioversion. He will continue therapy with warfarin; however, he is highly motivated to try an alternative agent. We have discussed the possibility of transitioning to Pradaxa, which is newly approved for non-valvular atrial fibrillation. I have given him a prescription for Pradaxa 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. and he will inquire as to whether or not this would be covered by his insurance. If so, we will transition him over the next few weeks. When he receives medication, he will stop Coumadin and two days later he will start Pradaxa. I have also reiterated that should he have to undergo invasive procedures, Pradaxa would need to be discontinued two days prior. He will not require monitoring of PT/INR while on this medication.

4. Status post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. He has had progressive decrease in his R-wave threshold. It raises the concern for need for lead revision. I have discussed this with his electrophysiologist, Dr. Mela. I have also discussed the issue of potentially upgrading him to CRT given his persistent New York Heart Association Class III symptoms. He will have a stress test first and his device will be checked once again in the office and a decision will be made thereafter. He may qualify for the echo CRT trial; however, he has had documented QRS duration of greater than 120 milliseconds. 

I will see him in followup in one month and he will call should he have any questions prior to that.

 OFFICE NOTE  

INTERVAL HISTORY: 

Mr. Fitzpatrick returned today for follow-up of coronary disease, with multiple postoperative complications after coronary bypass surgery, including ventricular arrhythmias. He has gradually increased his activity. Of the past week, he had a spell of increasing weakness and ankle edema, which has responded to an increase in his Lasix. He seems to be getting back to baseline from that. 


He has had no syncope or chest pain. He was seen by Dr. Singh today to assess his ventricular arrhythmias, and that evaluation is in progress. 


Review of Systems:  . 

No change in his systems review. 

Family and Social History: 

Family and social history have not changed. There is no pertinent new information which has bearing on the current problems. 


Physical Examination:  . 

He looks mildly fatigued. Blood pressure is 140/70. Central venous pressure is normal and lungs are clear. Heart shows regular rhythm with distant sounds. There is one plus bilateral ankle edema. 


Impression: . 

Hemodynamically, he is doing reasonably well. He is eating more, though not enough to do without the G-tube.     


Plan: . .  

He will continue his assessment with Dr. Singh. I made no change in his medications. I will see him here in follow-up routinely in three months, or sooner as needed.

Asked to see this 61 year old male admitted on 9/16/12 with CHF for dental evaluation prior to VAD/Heart transplant evaluation and resynchronization therapy.  


HPI:  (per LMR) 

Mr. Tostenson is a 61 yo man with  history of chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy and an EF of 15%, who presents for evaluation of candidacy for advanced cardiac therapies and resynchronization therapy. Mr. Tostenson's cardiac history began in 1997 when he originally presented with an  MI.  He underwent stent placement at that time. In 2002 he had 4 additional stents placed. In 2006 he had ICD implanted (no discharges).  In May 2011 he had an acute coronary syndrome. Mr. Tostenson reports that over the past 1-2 years he has had declining functional capacity. He reports that after doing yard work or taking his grandchildren to the park, he will experience fatigue and shortness of breath, requiring use of supplemental oxygen.  He reports that he will often spend the day in bed, following a strenuous activity.

ASSESSMENT: 61 year old male admitted on 9/16/12 with CHF awaiting VAD/Heart transplant evaluation and resynchronization therapy presents with no signs of acute infection. 

 

Based on a limited bedside exam and patient history there are no signs of acute dental infection. Without intraoral radiographs and a comprehensive examination we cannot rule out an occult source of dental infection. It is recommended that the patient follow-up with a local dentist when appropriate following discharge from the hospital.  


RECOMMENDATION:  

Patient cleared for cardiac surgery. 

Patient to follow up with local dentist after discharge for routine care. 


Thank you for the referral.  We will not follow.

 PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION NOTE

CONSULT REQUESTED BY:        Timothy Churchill - pager 32744   


REASON FOR CONSULT:            VAD/Heart transplant evaluation    


CC/PRESENTING PROBLEM:      Admitted for evaluation of candidacy for VAD/Heart transplant evaluation and resynchronization therapy.          


HPI:  Mr. Tostenson is a 61 yo man with  history of chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy and an EF of 15%, who presents for evaluation of candidacy for advanced cardiac therapies and resynchronization therapy. Mr. Tostenson's cardiac history began in 1997 when he originally presented with an  MI.  He underwent stent placement at that time. In 2002 he had 4 additional stents placed. In 2006 he had ICD implanted (no discharges).  In May 2011 he had an acute coronary syndrome. Mr. Tostenson reports that over the past 1-2 years he has had declining functional capacity. He reports that after doing yard work or taking his grandchildren to the park, he will experience fatigue and shortness of breath, requiring use of supplemental oxygen.  He reports that he will often spend the day in bed, following a strenuous activity. 


Mr. Tostenson appears to have an appropriate knowledge of the transplant process, due to information that he has received and due to researching online.  He is aware of the need for listing, the need for lifelong immunosuppression and the risks of rejection and malignancy.  He reports that he has some knowledge of ventricular assist devices, and currently has some hesitancy towards them, due to the psychological fears of having to depend upon a pump connected to external battery packs. 


Mr. Torstenson reports excellent adherence with medications. He reports that he has not been following fluid restriction and will often consume 3 liter bottles of water in a period of several hours. He also reports that he has historically been "a salt freak". He has stopped adding salt to his food, but has realized that he had not been correctly understanding how to read nutritional labels.

OK to continue PPI post transplant. 

Consider switching dabigatran to other agent peri-op period as dabigatran has no reversal agent and is required to discontinue at least a few days prior to invasive procedure.   

Okay to continue gabapentin for low extremity neuropathy.  

Okay to continue finasteride and oxybutynin for bladder symptoms.  

Okay to continue vitamin D3 and vitamin B.  

Consider switching oral antidiabetic to insulin post transplant to control possible steroid induced hyperglycemia. 

Consider switching atorvastatin to pravastatin.

ASSESSMENT: 61M w/ ischemic CMP, EF ~15%, severely dilated LV, chronic AF, with class III symptoms, objective impairment on exercise testing.  Understand RHC planned for tomorrow.  With respect to candidacy for CRT - technically he does warrant consideration, although the ischemic etiology of his cardiomyopathy as well as the nonspecific nature of his IVCD increase the odds that he will be a nonresponder or have limited response.  Furthermore, given his AF, an attempt at CRT would likely need to be done in conjunction with an AV node ablation in order to ensure that he received sufficient percent pacing to engender whatever benefit the resynchronization therapy could offer him.  In general, the utility of an attempt at CRT in him depends in large part upon the overall plan and picture, in terms of VAD/transplant, etc.  If the decision is continued medical management for now, then while I suspect relatively unlikely to have significant benefit, an upgrade to CRT (with AVJ) would nonetheless be reasonable to consider.  If, however, decision is made to proceed to VAD, I would not pursue upgrade.  I discussed the procedure and considerations that make him less likely to respond.  My general sense at present is that he is still coming to terms with the current evaluation and what it all may mean; he is clearly wanting to believe that CRT will offer him significant benefit.  Unfortunately, I think that is unlikely to be the case, although it is possible.  We will follow with you.

REASON FOR NUTRITION INTERVENTION: Nutrition assessment for cardiac transplant/VAD evaluation  


Patient Interview: Pt reports good appetite now and PTA. Since saw Dr. Stevenson in clinic 9/4/2012, in efforts to follow dietary restrictions and lose weight, pt has omitted adding salt to his food and is avoiding pasta and potatoes. "I'm adding apple vinegar to food instead of salt." Diet recall: coffee w/ cream and 1 sugar and toast w/ low calorie margarine (occasionally muffin, egg or fruit) for breakfast; tomato and onion or cucumber sandwich, grapes and strawberries (occasionally has 1-2 slices of low-sodium turkey or ham) for lunch; chicken (or steak 1x/wk) w/ beets and carrots or homemade hamburger and vegetable soup w/ crackers for dinner; celery and carrots w/ dip or fruit for snacks. Pt reports that his HGB A1c is normal so he has been told he does not need to check his blood sugar levels at home. He takes an oral medication for type 2 DM.

ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  

Classification of Malnutrition: At risk for developing malnutrition   

Estimated Requirements Based On: AWO  84.2 kg  

Estimated Energy Requirements based on 1725.5 kcal BMR, 1.25 Activity Factor, 1.15 Stress Factor, 0 kcal Repletion calories.  

Estimated Energy Requirements: 2480 kcal/day    Estimated Protein Requirements: 109 gm/day  


Assessment: 61yoM w/ h/o iCMP (EF 15%), s/p ICD, afib and type 2 DM who admitted w/ worsening HF symptoms and severe functional limitations for elective admission for cardiac transplant/VAD evaluation. Pt admitted well nourished at 126% IBW, 96% UBW, BMI 29.84kg/m2, w/ reported good appetite and normal admit albumin 4.7g/dl (reference range 3.5-5.2g/dl). However, pt remains at risk for developing malnutrition given end-stage HF. Pt just recently learned about dietary restrictions for HF and has made numerous dietary changes over the past two weeks. Discussed 2g Na and 2L FR diet w/ pt. Specifically reviewed sources of sodium in the diet, how to read a food label for sodium, seasoning w/o salt, what counts as a fluid and tips for sticking within the fluid restriction. In efforts to lose weight, pt has made many dietary changes, but omitting protein from breakfast and lunch most days. Discussed importance of protein to maintain lean muscle mass, aid glycemic control and increase satiety for weight loss efforts. Applauded replacing large portions of refined carbohydrates w/ fruit and vegetables. Pt asked numerous questions and anticipate good compliance w/ dietary restrictions. With continued dietary compliance, there are no contraindications to cardiac transplant/VAD from a nutrition standpoint.  


Nutrition Diagnosis Statement: Food and nutrition-related knowledge deficit related to lack of prior exposure to accurate nutrition related information as evidenced by HF diagnosis that requires food and nutrition knowledge.  


Diet Order: Diets: House   Na: 2gm Na   Sugar: consistent carbohydrate   Fat: Low sat fat/low cholesterol   Options: Fluid restriction (2000 mL/day)  


Other Recommendations: 
1. Agree w/ diet order as above. 
2. Continue daily weights. 
3. Provide MVI daily. 
4. Continue vitamin B complex and 1000 International Units of Cholecalciferol daily. 
5. Check 25(OH)D level as pt at risk for post-transplant osteoporosis. 
6. Check prealbumin and CRP levels to further assess pt's nutritional status and recent protein intake.
7. Glycemic control. Continue to check fingerstick levels prior to mealtimes and bedtime and cover w/ sliding scale insulin prn.

REFERRING PHYSICIAN: 

Jeffrey Colnes, M.D. 

Seacoast Cardiology Associates 

12 Hospital Drive, Suite 9 

York, ME 03909 


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy and an EF of 15% who presents for evaluation of candidacy for advanced cardiac therapies and resynchronization therapy. 


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old man who originally presented with an MI in 1997.  At that time, he underwent stent placement.  In 2002, he had 4 additional stents placed.  In 2006, he had an ICD implanted at York Hospital.  In 2010, he developed atrial fibrillation for which he was started on Coumadin and antiarrhythmics without maintenance of sinus rhythm.  He subsequently had an acute coronary syndrome in 05/2011.  A cardiac catheterization at that time revealed no flow-limiting lesions.  He was noted to have an EF of 15% with an LVEDP of 20 mmHg.  The patient was medically managed.  His symptoms have continued to worsen over the last few years.  He notes that he can barely climb one flight of stairs without becoming dyspneic.  He chronically uses 2 pillows to sleep.  He denies any PND, but does note occasional lower extremity edema.  He denies any abdominal bloating or early satiety.  He denies any palpitations, but notes that he has exertional lightheadedness and has had multiple episodes of presyncope but has never had frank syncope.  He denies any ICD therapies.  He recently had an up-titration of his diuretics with substantial improvement in his lower extremity edema.  He was referred to Dr. Lynne Stevenson of the Heart Failure Service at Brigham and Women's Hospital for evaluation for advanced therapies.  At that time, he underwent an exercise stress test.  He exercised for 3 METs and had a peak oxygen consumption of only 10.2 mL/kg/min with an RER of 1.13 and a VE/VCO2 slope of 46.  Based on this, he was felt to have significantly advanced cardiac disease with objective functional limitation and therefore he was admitted for evaluation of advanced therapies including VAD and transplant.  The patient is now being admitted for this.  At the current time, he does not note any worsening of his symptoms.  He notes that he often desats in the 85% range with ambulation and therefore has been on home oxygen therapy.  He also notes that he develops lower extremity claudication and cramping.  He has apparently been evaluated for peripheral vascular disease approximately 2 years ago and this was supposedly negative.  He has been told that most of his lower extremity symptoms are probably related to peripheral neuropathy from his diabetes.  Otherwise, the remainder of his review of systems is negative. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   

(1) Coronary artery disease as noted above'  

(2) Ischemic cardiomyopathy.  His most recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15%' 

(3) Atrial fibrillation with RVR,  

(4) Pneumonia in 1999,  

(5) Diverticulitis in 2000,  

(6) Hiatal hernia,  

(7) Costochondritis,  

(8) Type 2 diabetes mellitus 

(9) Arthritis of the right shoulder,  

(10) Deviated septum,  

(11) Lumbar scoliosis,  

(12) BPH status post TURP in 2009,  

(13) Incidental superficial bladder carcinoma, diagnosed in 2009 treated with resection and status post negative cystoscopies every 6 months,  

(14) status post left cataract surgery,  

(15) status post knee surgery. 


ALLERGIES:  He has allergies to penicillin, Flomax, Levaquin, Crestor, Lyrica, Celebrex, Naprosyn, nabumetone, ranitidine, Morphine and Coumadin. 


CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Diltiazem 120 mg daily, Lovaza 1 g daily, lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily, carvedilol 25 mg b.i.d., furosemide 40 mg b.i.d., Imdur 30 mg daily, Ecotrin 325 mg daily, metformin 500 mg b.i.d., gabapentin 900 mg t.i.d., losartan 50 mg daily, atorvastatin 10 mg daily, finasteride 0.5 mg daily, Pradaxa 150 mg b.i.d., spironolactone 25 mg daily, oxybutynin 5 mg daily, vitamin D 1000 units daily, and vitamin B 500 mg b.i.d. 


FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory. 


SOCIAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for a 30-pack-year smoking history.  He quit at the time of his first heart attack in 1997.  He used to drink socially, but has not drunk in several years.  He denies any illicit drug use.  He is a retired manager of New Hampshire State liquor store.  He has 2 children, both in their 30s and in good health. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today reveals a heart rate of 86 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 114/85.  He is breathing at a rate of 18 and is saturating 96% on room air.  In general, he is a well-appearing man in no acute distress.  His HEENT exam is unremarkable.  His neck exam shows no evidence of jugular venous distention or hepatojugular reflux.  His carotid upstrokes are brisk with a soft bruit on the left.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His cardiac exam reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm with a normal S1 and S2.  No S3, S4, or murmurs are appreciated.  His abdominal exam is notable for obesity, but is otherwise unremarkable for any hepatosplenomegaly.  His extremities reveal no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema and are warm.  He has 1+ DPs and PTs bilaterally. 


His EKG today shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of approximately 80 beats per minute.  He has evidence of an IVCD with a QRS duration of 158 milliseconds.  He has occasional PVCs. 


His laboratory values from this admission are pending. 


His echocardiogram from 09/04/12 shows an LV ejection fraction of 15-20% with an end-diastolic dimension of 6.9 cm.  He has global hypokinesis with regional variation.  His RV size and function are within normal limits.  He has severe left atrial enlargement.  He has trace mitral and mild tricuspid regurgitation with PA pressures estimated at 52 mmHg plus RA. 


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, Mr. Tostenson is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15-20%.  He has a significant functional limitation both by history as well as by objective testing.  He is now being admitted for consideration and evaluation for advanced therapies.  We have consented him for this workup.  We will send all the tests required for this evaluation.  Given his IVCD and his AFib, he does not appear to be an ideal candidate for resynchronization therapy.  However, we will ask our EP colleagues to see him and comment on the potential benefit that he may derive from this therapy.  Lastly, we will hold his Pradaxa in anticipation of performing a right heart catheterization to evaluate his PA pressures and tailored therapy.

CHF Intern Admission Note 


Name: Jerold Tostenson 

MRN: 27375526(BWH) 

DOB: 03/15/51 

Date: 09/16/2012 


Admitting Attending: Nohria 

Admitting Intern:  Churchill, Tim 

PCP: STEPHEN CHRISTO 

Cardiologist: Stevenson 


Reason for CHF Admission: Pre-VAD / Transplant evaluation 

History of Present Illness:  

Mr .Tostenson is a lovely 61 year old gentleman with a history of severe systolic HF (EF 15%), iCMP, h/o MI in 1997, s/p multiple stents, s/p ICD, now admitted with worsening heart failure symptoms and severe functional limitations for elective admission for VAD / txpt w/u.  


Mr. Tostenson's cardiac history began with MI in 1997, after which he had a stent placed. In 2002, he was cath'd again (unclear if for symptoms) and had 4 stents. ICD was placed in 2006. Developed AF in 2010, started on coumadin and trialed on pharmacologic therapy, without maintenance of sinus rhythm. He reportedly had ACS in May 2011, with mildly elevated troponin to 0.43. He was cath'd at the time, which revealed EF 15%, large caliber LM with no diseae, patent stent in LCX with good flow, multiple patent stents in LAD, 40% stenosis in LAD, 40% stenosis in Diagon 1, RCA without flow limiting lesions. Notably, this appeared to be a worsening of LV function over time, as he was reportedly discharged after his MI with EF of 35%. 

His heart failure symptoms have worsened considerably over the past 1-2 years. Symptoms are primarily DOE, along with intermittent edema. He also tends to sleep somewhat upright or with multiple pillows. He was relatively well compensated until summer 2012, and was able to remain fairly active. Over the past several months, however, his functional status has declined and his exercise tolerance has worsened. He is short of breath with very minimal activity such as walking less than a block or several stairs.  


In this setting, he came to see Dr. Stevenson in the Advanced Heart Disease Clinic to discuss further options, and the decision was made to admit him to the hospital for medical optimization and VAD / txpt eval.  


No recent fevers, chills, chest pain, palpitations; occasional nausea; +nocturnal urination (for which he takes several medications). No constiation / diarrhea. 

ROS: As per HPI, otherwise negative. 


Past Medical History:

Past Cardiac History: 


Echo 9/4/2012 

Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is moderately dilated. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is severely reduced at 15-20%. There is global hypokinesis with regional variation.
Right Ventricle: Normal right ventricular size, wall thickness, and contractility. A pacemaker or AICD wires are seen in the right heart.
Left Atrium: There is severe left atrial enlargement.
Right Atrium: The right atrium is normal.
Aortic Valve: The aortic valve is trileaflet, without significant dysfunction. There is no significant aortic regurgitation.
Mitral Valve: The mitral valve is mildly diffusely thickened. Trace mitral regurgitation is present.
Tricuspid Valve: The tricuspid valve is structurally normal. Mild tricuspid valve regurgitation is present. The tricuspid regurgitant velocity is 3.59 m/s, consistent with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 51.6 mmHg plus right atrial pressure of 10 mmHg. The PASP is moderately elevated and measures 61.6 mmHg.
Pulmonic Valve: Structurally normal pulmonic valve. There is no pulmonic 
stenosis. There is trace pulmonary valve regurgitation.
Venous: . Respirophasic variation is normal.
Pericardium/Pleura: No significant pericardial effusion is seen.

ETT 9/4/2012 

 In summary, the test results were:

     1. Functional capacity:  10.2 mL/kg/min (2.9 METS)at RER 1.13;VE/VCO2 slope 46
     2. Peak Heart Rate:  133 bpm (84% age-predicted maximal heart rate)and RER 1.13.
     3. Symptomatic response:  Non-ischemic.
     4. Peak Blood Pressure: 142/80
     5. Blood pressure response: Normal.
     6. ECG response:  Non-diagnostic test for ischemia due to baseline ECG abnormalities.
     7. Stress-induced arrhythmia:  atrial fibrillation and multifocal, isolated PVC's

     Final impression:

     1. Peak VO2 of 10.2ml/kg/min achieved (43% predicted peak VO2 based on the Wasserman formula)
     2. Elevated VE/VCO2 slope (46)
     2. Non-diagnostic test for ischemia due to baseline ECG abnormalities.  However no ischemic symptoms at RER 1.13

Dear Jeffrey and Stephen, 


I had the pleasure of meeting this patient and his wife today in Advanced Heart Disease Clinic.  To review his history briefly, he presented acutely with myocardial infarction in 1997.  Apparently, this was a somewhat atypical presentation after therapy for GERD, but he underwent a stent placement during the admission.  In 2002, he underwent catheterization and had 4 stents placed.  In August of the same year, said that one of the stents was partly closed.  In 2006, he had an ICD implanted in York Hospital.  He developed atrial fibrillation in 2010, at which time he was placed on Coumadin and has antiarrhythmic drug trial in 2011 without maintenance of sinus rhythm.  He an ICD placed in 2006.  He had an acute coronary syndrome in May 2011 with a troponin of 0.43.  He underwent catheterization during that admission.  The ejection fraction was 15%.  Coronary angiography of the right system reveals no flow-limiting lesions.  The left main was large caliber with no disease.  The circumflex was a large vessel with widely patent stent in the mid portion with excellent flow.  The LAD was a large capped caliber vessel, wrapping around the apex of the heart to supply a large portion of the inferior wall.  There are multiple stents throughout the LAD that were widely patent with TIMI 2 flow throughout the LAD.  In the mid portion of the LAD was a focal 40% stenosis just proximal to a stent.  There was a large first diagonal branch with a 40% lesion at the ostium with good flow throughout.  The right PDA was a small vessel with no lesions.  Left ventricular diastolic pressure was 20, no evidence of mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis from the catheterization. 


He had worsening symptoms throughout 2011.  These were symptoms of exertional dyspnea and general fatigue.  He nonetheless tried to remain very active, coaching sports.  During the spring of 2012, he had significant improvement of his symptoms from increase of his furosemide dose to 40 mg daily.  This also resolved the edema that he had developed.  His symptoms again worsened and appeared to improve with oxygen therapy, which he uses frequently now at night and when he is active during the day. 


Currently, he feels his function is very limited.  He describes himself able to dress without stopping, slightly limited showering and bathing, extremely limited walking a block, doing yard work or housework or climbing his stairs and feels he is also moderately bothered by his medications. 


He did not describe difficulty breathing at night until he was on the examining table.  When I asked him how his breathing would be best and he stated that he always uses several pillows or set up in a chair to sleep at night, although sometimes could achieve similar results by turning on his side.  He has had no recent chest discomfort, no palpitations, syncope, or presyncope.  He does not often have postural dizziness. 


He had diabetes diagnosed over 5 years ago, has remained on oral therapy only.  He has pain in his legs, which he describes as mostly paresthesias, for which he takes gabapentin 900 t.i.d.  He has a small cataract in his left eye noted in 2011.  He had surgery for cataract there in January 2012. 


He does not have significant family history except for one relative with heart rhythm problems at age 74.  He has 1 brother and 2 half sisters in good health.  Mother died of COPD at 79.  Father died in a car accident at 28.  He smoked cigarettes until 15 years ago.  He carries a diagnosis of hypertension and dyslipidemia. 


Other past medical history, knee surgery in 2004, hip disease 2007, prostate surgery for malignant biopsy in 2009, diagnosis of superficial bladder cancer at that time. 


Past medical history is significant for vigorous childhood and sports, basketball, baseball, and football.  He has not had any problems with tuberculosis, asthma, muscle disease, liver disease, although he drank heavily until he was in his late 30s. 


He lives with his wife, is a retired New Hampshire state liquor store manager and enjoys coaching basketball.  They have a daughter and a son in their 30s with no health problems. 


His review of systems is positive for snoring at night, neuropathic pain in his legs during exercise and at rest, no problems with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, no difficulty with urination, no heat or cold intolerance, no recurrent joint swelling, no difficulty with balance.  Review of systems is otherwise negative.  He has no history of depression.  Currently, he is not drinking any alcohol, has no history of falls and no concerns about personal safety. 


He describes a very vivid allergy to Coumadin with chills and severe body aches, which he states he also gets to Crestor. 


His current medications are diltiazem 120, Lovaza 1 g daily, Lansoprazole 30 twice daily, carvedilol 25 twice daily, furosemide 40 mg daily, isosorbide 30 mg daily, aspirin 325, metformin 500 mg twice daily, Neurontin 900 three times daily for leg spasm, losartan 50, atorvastatin 10, finasteride 0.5 mg daily, pradaxa 150 mg twice daily, spironolactone 25, oxybutynin 5 mg daily, vitamin D 1000 units daily, and vitamin B 500 twice daily. 


On physical examination, he is a very pleasant and oriented man who appears in general health except for dyspnea with any activity.  His chest is clear to auscultation and percussion.  Blood pressure is 120/84 with irregular atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of approximately 95.  There is cervical adenopathy or thyromegaly.  His eyes are without jaundice.  Mouth and throat are clear.  His left ventricular impulse is displaced to the left about 3 cm.  He has a 1/6 systolic murmur, very soft third heart sound at the apex, quite a pronounced pulmonic component of the second sound, suggesting PA pressures in the range of 50-60 mm.  His jugular venous pressure is difficult to determine with his broad neck, but by multiple maneuvers, it is probably 12 cm with a positive hepatojugular reflux.  His carotids are 2+, prominent, and without bruits.  His liver percusses at about 3 cm below the costal margin, but I cannot feel an edge.  His distal pulses are 2+.  He has no edema at this time and no cyanosis.  His abdomen is obese, and no organs palpated.  His total weight is 230 pounds and height of 6 feet.  His strength is 4/4 in all extremities, and his reflexes are 2+ in the lower extremities. 


His cardiopulmonary exercise test is sobering and heart rate is 88 and going to 133, blood pressure 110/78 and going to 142/80.  There is marked periodic breathing throughout exercise with a peak VO2 of only 10.2 after 3 METs.  His VE/VCO2 slope was 46 with a peak R of 1.13.  O2 saturation remained at 95% or higher.  Nondiagnostic ECG changes with exercise. 


The baseline ECG has atrial fibrillation with occasional wider complex beats at a rate of 85.  The largest QRS is in leads V2 and V3 with a duration of 160 milliseconds.  It is not a typical bundle-branch block pattern, but looks like an extensive anterior infarct with some lateral Q-waves and a left axis deviation. 


The echocardiogram shows estimated ejection fraction of 15-20%, LV dimension of 6.9, trace mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure 52+ right atrial pressure.  Right ventricular function is read as normal, which is difficult to ascertain from this echo.  In some views, it appears small, and in others it appears to have a dilated minor axis but certainly is not severely impaired. 


Assessment: 

1.  Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction appears to relate to a large myocardial infarction 15 years ago with remarkable stability for many years afterwards, as he was discharged with an ejection fraction of 35% from that initial event.  There does not appear to be any evidence of recurrent ischemia.  The role of atrial fibrillation in aggravating his decompensation is not clear at this time.  His other habits are healthy except for his chronic weight.  His BMI is approximately 34, which does not exclude him from transplantation, although it puts him in a precarious spot with regard to becoming ineligible. 

2.  Current hemodynamic status is somewhat unusual.  His filling pressures appeared to be high, judging by his symptoms.  His jugular venous pressure is not as high as I might have expected from his symptoms, which may go along with reasonably good RV function.  His blood pressure is quite well maintained, despite what appears to be a very poor cardiac reserve on his exercise test, so this may result from a relatively high systemic vascular resistance in someone with a history of hypertension.  His PA pressures appear to be high on exam, high on echo, and high on previous echos, hopefully with a major reversible component. 

3.  Related risks.  He is on Pradaxa for his atrial fibrillation due to his apparent allergy to Coumadin.  He has a QRS that is over 150, but with a poorly defined bundle-branch pattern reflecting, in large part, a prior infarct.  This combined with his current atrial fibrillation puts him in the lower likelihood of major improvement with CRT, but certainly agree that this should be considered.  He will have to have a very tight control of his ventricular response in order to maximize his chance of benefiting from CRT. 


Potential for further intervention, at this time, there are no obvious major contraindications to cardiac transplantation, although there is concern about the degree of his diabetes and diabetic neuropathy, which of course is a problem with his immunosuppression.  His obesity puts him in a borderline eligibility, and we have discussed this at length with regard to the importance of having a prudent, but moderate approach to weight loss.  There are no obvious contraindications to LVAD as a bridge or as destination therapy, and I have discussed this possible option with him as well.  With regard to medical therapy under observation in the hospital, it may be reasonable to stop his diltiazem, treat his hypertension and ventricular rate with other agents.  He might benefit from a very aggressive afterload reduction if indeed his SVR is quite high. 


I have spent 40 minutes reviewing this with the patient and then with the patient and his wife with regard to his overall trajectory of disease, which is markedly downhill.  He understands that he needs further medical therapy in order to treat his symptoms and to determine whether he is eligible for other interventions.  We are planning this after the CRT procedure that is scheduled with you.  We have also advised that should he have any decompensation that requires urgent hospitalization in the meantime, that it would be reasonable to have him brought here so that we can accelerate this evaluation process. 


It is a real pleasure to meet this patient and his wife, and I hope that we will be able to provide him with meaningful options to extend his good quality life. 


Sincerely,

 Interval History:
 Mr William Athayde is a 69 yo with three vessel CAD, not amenable to CABG and systolic dysfunction, LVEF 25%. He is s/p stroke and has been diagnosed with vascular dementia, so is a poor historian. The majority of his history was gathered through his health care proxy, Maria and is companion is Cheryl Egan 
who is wheelchair-bound and did not accompany him to today's visit but who most likely will telephone us for further information.

Currently William states that he is unable to go up flights of stairs because of shortness of breath and gets winded with 50 yards of walking. His blood pressure readings have been stable as have his home weights.

She denies any pedal edema or chest discomfort. He does have some significant psychosocial issues managed on Seroquel and states that sometimes he has great trouble sleeping. His blood pressures have been in the 111-135/55-73 range.

Assessment and Plan: 
69yo M with CM-CAD, conduction system disease, and NYHA II-III Sx who returns for follow up. He is on an appropriate phermacotherapy. He describes NYHA Class II-III symptoms. In light of his significant conduction system disease (baseline sinus bradycardia and wide QRS complex) this limits our ability to Rx with beta-blockade. For this reason and to promote resyncrhonization, I am pleased that Dr. Singh feels he may be an appropriate candidate for CRT.

 Reason for visit:
 Consultation Cardiac Arrhythmia Service- Ischemic Cardiomyopathy

 Interval History:
 Mr William Athayde is a 69 yo with three vessel CAD, not amenable to CABG and systolic dysfunction, LVEF 25%. He is s/p stroke and has been diagnosed with vascular dementia, so is a poor historian. The majority of his history was gathered through his health care proxy, Maria and is companion is Cheryl Egan 
who is wheelchair-bound and did not accompany him to today's visit but who most likely will telephone us for further information.

He was referred over to us by Dr. Lewis for consultation of device implantation after increased diuretic need accompanied by activity intolerance. Currently William states that he is unable to go up flights of stairs because of shortness of breath and gets winded with 50 yards of walking. His blood pressure readings have been stable as have his home weights.

She denies any pedal edema or chest discomfort. His HCP has not observed any symptoms with exertion, except that his walks now are of a shorter duration and distance. He does have some significant psychosocial issues managed on Seroquel and states that sometimes he has great trouble sleeping. One of the obstacles towards having a device implant he would be staying overnight in the hospital. We would need to facilitate to have his friend Tommy stay with him in order to keep his anxiety at bay. He does report that he has some degree of fear and paranoia and prefers to be indoors. He does appear to be wobbly in his legs on occasion. When she observes this, she does check his blood pressure and finds it on the low side (less than 100 systolic). 

He denies any difficulty sleeping but does state that he has horrible dreams and is followed locally by a psychologist. His blood pressures have been in the 110-135/55-66 range. He has occasional low blood pressure readings in the 90-95/53-60 range. 

Previously, we discussed the possibility of device therapy as an option. Mr Athayde was not inclined to pursue any invasive therapy at our first appointment. Teaching regarding CRT therapy and implantation techniques were reviewed and teaching handout provided to William.

 EKG:
 Sinus bradycardia @ 48 bpm, pr 156 ms, QRS 152 ms , QTc 441

Assessment and Plan: 
He appears to be fairly well compensated without congestive symptoms. He describes NYHA Class II-III symptoms. 

Cardiomyopathy .. - We have recommended that he undergo CRT implant based on his NYHA class III symptoms and LVEF of 25% with decreased activity tolerance. He has some anxiety as well as paranoia issues so we have recommended that he discuss this with Dr. Lewis. We will proceed once we hear back from them with scheduling implantation date.

He has CXR req and lab slips should he decide to proceed 
The ECG shows significant conduction delay, QRS duration 152ms. with LAD, RBBB and pulse rate of 48 bpm. We asked that he discuss his wishes regarding invasive procedures with his HCP. They will call us if they are interested in proceeding with the implant.

Coronary artery disease.. - Secondary prevention would include glucose and BP control. He is performing aerobic activity daily and his weight is at goal. We will request copies of recent lipids to determine if he is at goal.

Anxiety disorder .. - On soquel with local counselor. Dr. ngh provided the option for general anesthesia during the case f that would be more favorable for him.

 DX Tests Ordered:
 Electrolytes. Urinalysis, chest x-ray, BNP and LFTs

Disposition:
1 month post CRT implant

The patient was seen by Mary Orencole NP, along with by Dr. Singh M.D., PhD who reviewed the history, physical examination and relevant diagnostic test reports and determined the assessment and plan.

 

Mary P Orencole NP

 Education/Counselling:
 Educated regarding device implantation as well as electrical conduction issues occurring in his heart. He knows to continue to monitor daily weights, blood pressure and heart failure and angina symptoms.

HPI and Hospital Course:  

87M w/ non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (by stress) and EF 25%, LBBB, L cerebellar stroke who presents as a transfer from OSH for syncope.  His initial presentation to OSH was for a witnessed syncopal event at the dinner table, where he was noted to appear unresponsive, diaphoretic, and drooling on himself, and found to have a SBP of 80.  He was brought to the couch and returned to his normal self within 5 minutes, with a normal blood pressure.  He himself has only a vague recall of these events; much of this history comes by report from his family.  He denied any prodromal symptoms, including lightheadedness, chest pain, or shortness of breath at the time.  Of note, he had been started on amiodarone for suppression of ventricular ectopy by a cardiologist in VT, and his carvedilol had earlier been stopped due to bardycardia this year.  He was brought to OSH by EMS and admitted, and Cardiology (Dr. Weinfeld) was consulted.  Amiodarone was discontinued and he was started on low dose carvedilol. TTE was performed, showing EF <30% with global hypokinesis with regional variabilitiy, and mild AI.  Enzymes were negative, and he remained asymptomatic.  Transfer was arranged to MGH under Dr. Mansours service for consideration of AICD placement, given the persistently poor EF and possibility that the symptoms could be VT.

Sinus bradycardia @ 59 bpm.  Left axis w/ LBBB pattern.  Unchanged from 11/28 ECG from OSH. 


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 

87M w/ non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and EF 25%, LBBB, L cerebellar stroke who presents as a transfer from OSH for syncope for evaluation for AICD placement.  On exam by EP, he had a 6 second pause with carotid massage, suggesting sinus nodal disease.  This may be exacerbated by beta-blocker (which he needs for his cardiomyopathy) and the anticholinergic effects of galantamine (needed for his dementia).  Sinus node dysnfunction may very well be the cause of his syncopal event, and he would likely benefit from pacemaker placement.  The decision to place an AICD is less clear; he does not appear to be symptomatic from heart failure, making the case for CRT less strong, nor has he required heart failure treatment. 


Rhythm 

-          Telemetry 

-          Monitor lytes 

-          EP to decide on AICD placement 

-          CXR, u/a, coags for pre-AICD evaluation

Dear Dr. Abramson: 


Today, I saw your patient, Norman Gnagey, in follow up for cardiomyopathy.  The patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of hypertension, cardiomyopathy with moderately to severely decreased left ventricular systolic function (non-ischemic by nuclear stress testing) diagnosed after a 1-2008 cerebrovascular accident.  The patient reports that since his last office visit, he has continued to do well.  The patient denies recurrent chest pain or chest pressure.  The patient denies dyspnea at rest or with exertion.

Impression 

The patient has had improvement in recent headaches with improved blood pressure control but given his cardiomyopathy would benefit from advancement of his ACE-inhibitor dose.  I have discussed with the patient and his wife and daughter my recommendation increase in lisinopril. 


We have previously discussed the benefits of the Cardiovascular Health CHF Clinc for adjusting his medications and regaining his strength after his stroke. 


My recommendations and plan are as follows: 

1.  Increase in lisinopril to 20 mg bid 

2.  I will contact the patient's VT cardiologist about the above medication changes. 

3.   The patient is to follow-up with you and with me in 12-2008.  In follow-up consideration may be given to enrollment in the Congestive Heart Failure Clinic. 


Sincerely yours, 

Mark S. Weinfeld, M.D. 


Addendum 11-13-2008: 

I spoke with Dr. Keating.  She recalls that the patient was noted to have very frequent ventricular ectopy.  Increase in his ACE-I dose was limited by hypotension.  Carvedilol advancement was stopped by his primary due to bradycardia (It is not clear if cardiology would have stopped this medication). 


The concern was raised that his frequent ventricular ectopy may have led to or contributed to his low EF (discussed with EP).  A trial of amiodarone to suppress ventricular ectopy with subsequent checking of LV function was planned.   


Dr. Keating speculates that the recent development of recurrent hypertension suggests improvement in LV systolic function. 


She will fax records. 


Consideration may be given to a repeat echo after 4-6 months on amiodarone (which would likely be in 2-4/2009).

Dear Drs. Lamattina and Semigran, 

We had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Clark today in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service regarding his atrial fibrillation and flutter. We will briefly review his history for our records. As you know, Mr. Clark is a 79yo man with persistent atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter dating to before his surgery with recent echo evidence of LV dysfunction (LVEF 15% on 7/15/14, down from 46% on 8/14/13). He underwent mitral valve replacement utilizing a 31 mm porcine bioprosthesis, tricuspid repair, primary closure of patent foramen ovale, amputation of the LA appendage, left sided endocardial cryoMAZE procedure and atrial flutter ablation on 7/15/2013. He developed complete heart block post op and had a dual chamber PPM (STJ) placed on 7/24/2013. He also has a history of hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. In August 2013 he was found to be back in atrial fibrillation and has remained there since according to PPM interrogation. 

Since his surgery, he has had persistent exertional shortness of breath and fatigue. Repeat echocardiogram in Aug 2013 showed left atrial dilation to 56mm, dilated left ventricle with mildly impaired function, LVEF 46%. His mitral valve was well seated without evidence of paravalvular leak. He has mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. He has a tricuspid ring and mild tricuspid insufficiency. His estimated RVSP is 30mmHg. He attended cardiac rehab for 3 months and was able to increase his endurance to 40 mins of exercise. His heart rate and blood pressure response was flat. 

Since April, he felt the fatigue was more marked and he was more easily short of breath. He was pushing himself to exercise regularly but he notes increased respiratory rate and depth even at times at rest. An echocardiogram on 7/15/14 showed a drop in LVEF of 15% with bi-atrial enlargement, LV dilation and impaired systolic function. He has LVH with posterior wall and septum of 12mm. He has mild aortic valve stenosis and regurg with peak gradient of 17mm and mean gradient of 4mmHg. His valves were otherwise functioning normally. His estimated RVSP 36mmHg. He was suspected of having possible contribution to his LV dysfunction from tachycardia. PPM interrogation 8/11/14 at Dr. Lamattina's office showed heart rates consistently between 85-130 in atrial fibrillation 100% of the time. His Toprol was increased from 50mg to 75mg and valsartan was added to his regimen. 

At his visit in September we increased his Toprol to 100mg BID for improved rate control. He is tolerating the change well and siince that time he has noted improvement in his energy level and he feels less dyspnea with exertion than previously but he remains limited when walking uphills. A holter done on 10/6/14 showed a minimum HR of 68 bpm, average of 76 and max of 93 with 1880 PVCs. Repeat echocardiogram 10/30/14 showed improvement in his EF to 25%. Interrogation of his device today shows he is AP-VP 96% and AS-VP 3.8% of the time with HRs in the 70s for over 95% of the time. He denies chest pain, orthopnea, edema, syncope or presynocpe. He remains on warfarin for thromboembolic protection with CHADS of 6.

Assessment and Plan: 

Cardiomyopathy .. - Mr. Clark is a 79 yo man s/p MVR with bioprosthetic valve, cryoMAZE and LAA amputation in July of 2013. He has had worsened symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue for the past 5 months or so and is NYHA class 2-3. His metoprolol was increased with improvement in rate control and he was started on valsartan. Repeat echo has shown a mild improvement in his EF to 25%. He is now V paced 96% of the time. Given the situation we have recommended upgrade to CRT-D. The procedure of CRT-D upgrade was explained in detail to the patient. The alternatives and benefits of CRT-D upgrade were discussed in detail. We also discussed the risks associated with device implantation, including (but not limited to) the risk of infection (requiring system explantation if it were to occur), reaction to skin preparation agents, reaction to local anesthesia and sedation, reaction to contrast agents (if used), venous and arterial damage or perforation, cardiac perforation, pneumothorax, hemothorax, myocardial infarction, stroke and death. The patient understands and consents to proceed. They will shower with Hibiclens the evening before and the morning of the planned procedure date of 11/13/14. His medications will remain the same and we will contact Emerson Hospital anticoagulation clinic to drift his INR down to around 2 for his procedure. He will remain on the same medical regimen at this time. 

Atrial fibrillation .. - Mr. Clark has long term persistent atrial fibrillation in the setting of MVR and a dilated LA despite a cryoMAZE in July of 2013. His rate is better controlled with higher Toprol dosing. He remains on anti-coagulation with CHADS of 6.

 Reason for visit:
 Follow up of ongoing dyspnea and fatigue with exertion.

 Interval History:
 Mr. Clark is a 79yo with mitral valve disease s/p replacement and atrial fibrillation and flutter s/p amputation of the LA appendage, left sided endocardial cryoMAZE procedure and atrial flutter ablation on 7/15/2013 at the time of his mitral valve replacement. He developed complete heart block post op and had a dual chamber PPM (STJ) placed on 7/24/2013. He also has a history of hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. In August 2013 he was found to be back in atrial fibrillation and was noted to have a significant drop in his LVEF from 46% to 15%. 

He was seen here 8/26 and Diovan was added to metoprolol as part of his neurohormonal blockade. He was seen by EP a week previous to this appt. and had his metoprolol increased for high a-fib rates. He was tolerating the higher dose of metoprolol, but when the valsartan was added, he called to report some low BP readings in the 88-99/56-65 about 1 1/2 hours after his medication dose on the first day of taking valsartan. He did not have any dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, syncope, pre-syncope or chest discomfort. He has been tolerating it without any further hypotension since then. 

He comes in today, feeling better with regards to his energy and appetite. His weight has been stable in the 174-176 range and he denies any symptoms of fluid retention. He continues to have dyspnea with stairs or with longer duration of walking. He has been able to walk daily outdoors with his wife for about 20 minutes without problems. He is using resistance bands, but still has to reduce the repetitions and duration of this exercise compared to previously. He has a lateral thigh muscle pain with walking and thinks this limits him most- more than fatigue or dyspnea. Even at rest if he presses on his muscle, he feels tenderness. He is careful to pace himself in his activity, to avoid too high a heart rate. 

His home readings for BP in Sept 90-120/65-79 and pulses in the 67-72 (1X 102) and in October 100-110/62/80 and pulse 69-72 (1X 80), with two BP readings of 90/60 and November 100-110/62-80 and pulse 70. 

We reviewed his most recent echocardiogram performed at local cardiologist office in Concord- LVEF improved to 25%, LVH, moderate mitral stenosis s/p bioprosthetic valve replacement, and normal RV function size and function with estimated RVSP 28mmHg.

Recent improvement in rate control as well as titration of neurohormonal blockade has resulted in modest improvement to 25%. 
We will continue with up-titration of valsartan to 80mg twice a day. 
We will attempt a small reduction in diuretic to maintain his current weight and allow for further up-titration of his ARB. He knows to use a sliding scale based on weight with Furosemide 40mg for wt> 177. Furosemide 20mg for wt 177 or less. He knows to call his health care team for weight changes of more than 2 lbs and changes in symptoms or activity tolerance. He will continue to follow a low sodium diet and perform regular aerobic exercise. 

He was seen by the Electrophysiology service and options for device therapy was discussed.He is going to proceed with CRT-D upgrade. 

Atrial fibrillation .. - He appears to be atrial pacing today, so no longer in atrial fib. His symptoms are much improved as well. He should continue higher dose Toprol. Remainder of paln per EPS. He remains on anti-coagulation with CHADS of 6. 

Heart failure  - Inactivated 

Habits/Risk Screening: 
Drug use status: none 
Alcohol use status: moderate 1.5 oz daily, 1/2 cup of wine
Smoking status: former smoker 1/2ppdX25years. Quit in 1984.
Activity level: moderate currently abstaining from his previous exercise as directed

History of The Present Illness: 55 yo F with CRF's including hyperlipidemia, and medical h/o significant for Adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy (EF 30%), AFib, PE/DVT, breast CA (s/p lumpectomy 1996 with XRT and CMF x 6, recurrence in left axilla 1997 treated with adriamycin and taxol x 4, recurrent DCIS in left breast 2000 s/p mastectomy and TRAM reconstruction). Pt's cardiac history is notable for adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy with EF 30-35% in 1997 at OSH that initially improved to 40% in 1998. A cardiac catherization in 1998 demonstrated mild athersclerotic plaques with small vessels, but no significant CAD. In 2002, she had DIC c/b PE/DVT with EF 15% in that setting, but improved on that hospitalization to 27%. Repeat TTE in 2002 demonstrated Ef 45%, which again declined in 2003 in setting of URI/PNA to EF 18%. Subsequently, her cardic data has been as follows: 

-ETT 4/1998: 10 minutes exercise, 11 METS, with peak DP 32,364; negative EKG for ischemia 

-TTE 3/2004 with EF 30%, diffuse LV hypokinesis with minor regional variation, mildly dilated LA, and normal RV 

-RHC 12/2003 with RA 22, RV 37/24, mean PW 23, and PA 27/23 with mean 30; thermodilution CO 2.8, CI 1.55, PVR 200 


According to prior office notes, Pt was recently hospitalized 6/17 to 6/27 with colitis believed to be ischemic, with hospitalization c/b PNA, AF RVR and CHF exacerbation. She was being followed in clinic by Dr. John Levinson and was diuresed from weight 169 to 155 with likely dehydration resulting. On 7/7, she was found to have borderline BP of 92/60, HR 100 and her diuresis was held. She was also found to have BUN/Cr 26/2.2 up from baseline 11/1.0. Lisinopril was held in this setting. She complained on visit with PCP, Dr. Weiss, on 7/8 of DOE with minimal (5 steps) activity. Her weight was 164, and JVP elevated. Her lasix was continued, as well as lisinopril with plans to repeat CT for PNA concern, which subsequently showed improvement. Her LFT's were elevated as well, and amiodarone was held, with verapamil increased to bid dose, from qd. On the morning of admission, Pt complained of increased SOB, and reported black feet x 45 minutes, that then resolved to PCP in phone conversation. She continued to have increased LE edema, and was sent to MGH ED for further evaluation. She expresses feeling fatigue, SOB, cough with sputum, night sweats over the last week, with progressive LE edema.  


In ED, Pt was afebrile at 97.3, in AF RVR at 110's-120's, R 38, BP was initially unobtainable, but was later 94/61 with arterial line on levophed 4. She was able to speak in full sentences and report history. A bedside TTE was performed revealing massively dilated RV and LV with additional hypokinesis, severe TR and MR. Her D-dimer was > 10,000, INR > 10, CK 2100 with negative troponins, and lactate of 17. PE protocol CT was unable to be performed 2/2 elevated Cr at 3.8. She was given amp/gent/flagyl for presumed sepsis as well as 3 L NS, Zofran, and Reglan. She was initially placed on heparin for concern of PE, but then found to have increased INR with ? DIC, so this was stopped, especially after she developed coffee ground emesis (200 cc via NGT). In ED, she reports the interval development of nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting that had not been present before. She denies any PND, orthopnea, chest pain.

Assessment: Pt is a 55 yo F with h/o breast CA, AF, h/o PE/DVT with DIC in past, and toxin-induced cardiomyopathy with EF 30%, and recent ischemic colitis presenting with increased constitutional complaints, SOB, and LE edema with progressive GI complaints p/w DIC, severe lactic metabolic acidosis (with fairly appropriate compensation), muti-organ system failure (DIC, ARF, hepatic failure) and significant cardiac decompensation in this setting. It is still unclear to me whether the lactic acidosis is 2/2 distal emboli to bowel from chronic AF or if the lactic acidosis is a response to diffuse bowel and diffuse tissue hypoxia 2/2 decompenasted CHF. It may be that the increase in verapamil dose led to cardiac decompensation and poor tissue perfusion, with resultant end organ failure. In any event, it appears that her cardiac function has significantly declined in this setting. A PA catheter will be needed to better evaluate her cardic physiology and volume status. It is also important to consider other causes of indolent, subacute decompensation, like endocarditis or other septic etiology. As far as her AF RVR, I believe her hemodynamics are stable, and that the tachycardia is likely an appropriate response to her current decompensated state.  


Plan: 

1. Cardiac Pump: 

-PA line to evaluate volume status and direct therapeutic options 

-Inotropy: Holding digoxin in setting of renal failure; consider dobutamine after PA line obtained and values can guide therapy as likely will benefit greatly from increased inotropy.  

-Preload: Holding diuresis now as clinically dry with good response to IVF; CVP elevated; awaiting PA numbers to guide management of volume status 

-Afterload: appears to have high SVR on clinical exam with cool extremities, but BP stable; await PA line again for management 

-Holding home medications for now 


2. Cardiac Ischemia: 

-Troponin and CK elevation 2/2 diffuse cardiomyopathy with BNP > 70,000 and poor perfusion of heart as well as other tissues 

-EKG with widened QRS, but likely metabolic disarry as culprit; doubt true cardiac ischemia, but stress and demand may be contributing, as this is a high stress situation and even minimal fixed coronary lesions may become significant in this setting; will f/o enzymes q8h 


3. Cardiac Rhythm: 

-AF RVR; but holding rate control as may be appropriate compensation to CO contribution 

-Hemodynamically stable with this rate 

-Favor amiodarone in this setting if rate control needed 

-Continue levoxyl; f/u TSH 


4. ARF: 

-Will likely require HD vs CVVH if Cr still does not improve without UOP 

-Monitor I/O's 

-Renal c/s following 


5. Metabolic acidosis: 

-Improved with Na bicarbonate IV; will push prn 

-Appears to be compensating with ventilation well on her own; May need intubation if tires from increased WOB 

-2/2 lactic acidosis with high anion gap; f/u lytes and lactate frequently for trend of course; surgery consulted and concerned for bowel ischemia; will follow exam; ? OR if worsens 

-Continue amp/levo/flagyl (renal dosed) for possibility of gut flora translocation in this setting 


6. Coagulopathy/DIC: 

-Likely 2/2 MODS; FFP as per surgery team; vitamin K SC 

-Monitor coags; f/u DIC panel 

-Monitor for bleed prn  


7. H/O PE: 

-Monitor off coagulation 

-Will need to restart eventually as coagulopathy improves 

-No evidence of PE clinically with good oxygenation and ventilation 


8. FEN: 

-NPO for possible surgery 

-Monitor lytes frequently 


9. Prophylaxis: 

-No anticoagulation in this setting; monitor PT and INR with h/o DVT 

-Nexium

Visit Note 


Patient Name: MOONEY, ANNE M MRN: 2084309 

Dictated Date: 07/08/2005 Dictated By: Charles Weiss 


Date of Visit: 07/08/2005 


SUBJECT: Office visit, medical followup. 


Anne is being seen a couple of days after seeing John Levinson in his office, both in followup of a number of medical issues. She was hospitalized from 6/17 to 6/27/05 for colitis that is clinically and pathologically appeared to be ischemic. She also had atrial fibrillation with a rate that was hard to control. X-rays suggested right upper lobe pneumonia and she did have a cough, but had significant heart failure with pulmonary venous hypertension. A CT of the chest and pelvis did not show evidence of pulmonary emboli and her warfarin was therapeutic upon admission and throughout.  


On 7/08/05 visit, she had further diuresis by Dr. Levinson with a weight of 169.5 at 6/27/05 hospital discharge, down as low as 155 with decreased swelling of her feet, but feeling tired and clinically dehydrated. He saw her in the office on 7/07/05 with BP low at 92/60, heart rate 100 and irregularly irregular and held her diuretic for 2 days including the 2 days prior to her visit here. Of note, laboratory studies drawn in his office that day included a BUN/creatine of 26/2.2 up from 11/1.0 on 6/25/05. She also had an elevated CPK, elevated LDH and elevated SGOT, which was more elevated than the minor abnormalities that she had had in the hospital. A CBC was normal. Sedimentation rate was normal at 11.  


In review of her medications, it is noted that she has been taking lisinopril 40 mg daily still, though it is not on my discharge summary or on Dr. Levinson's list, I think having been stopped to make more room for rate active agents.  


She continues to feel easily winded, with just 5 steps in her little house. She thinks she is a little bit more short of breath walking around the house on the flat then she was even when she left the hospital. Her sleep is restless and she feels tired. She has some burning when she urinates, but no other urinary symptoms. (Urinalysis done today was negative.) She has been limiting her fluid intact to 2 quarts a day, as recommended. She continues to have a cough, mainly in the late afternoon and evening and with a scant white or clear drainage. She has multiple formed, small stools per day, not at night, and just feels as though she empties her bowels a little bit at a time. The stools are soft. She is having sweats again, but no fevers.  


On exam, office weight 164 (was 156 at home on 7/05 before the Lasix was held for 2 days). BP 120/80. Pulse 96 to 110, irregularly irregular. O2 saturation 98%. She actually does not look bad in terms of general appearance. The JVP still seems elevated, but the chest is clear except for some courser rales at the left base. Cardiac exam is unchanged. Abdomen is benign and there is 1-2+ edema on the left and trace on the right, decreased from previously. 


As noted, a urinalysis was negative for evidence of infection. Protein only trace.  


There are obviously some things of concern. The renal function is repeated to make sure that it is more normal with holding of her Lasix. Her rate is still not well-controlled. Dr. Levinson thought that it might be compensatory for her low blood pressure, but that does not seem to be the case. She may well have some residual pneumonia and we also need to make sure there is not some other process going on in her lungs. I note that she had some lymphadenopathy seen on CT scan that had not been seen previously, though this certainly could have been accounted for by her CHF or pneumonia. The enzyme abnormalities suggest that there may be an element of muscle inflammation. She is not taking a statin. She has not had any dark urine suggesting myoglobulinuria. The SGOT was elevated more than before, though this may turn out to be muscle rather liver.  


She will resume a lower dose of Lasix after having held a couple of doses, as Dr. Levinson had recommended. I will leave her on the lisinopril for now, as long as her blood pressure is okay, but this may need to be stopped again to make room for more rate active agents. Full LFTs are done as well as a CPK and CKMBs and isoenzymes. Renal function and electrolytes are also repeated, as noted above. She will also get another chest CT scan, without contrast, to see if there are new abnormalities or worsened abnormalities that might explain her shortness of breath. Dr. Levinson and I will touch base on 7/11/05, and Anne Marie will also call me that day, assuming she has had her CT scan done.

Narrative:
   The patient returns today after recent hospital admission in late June with
abdominal pain and nausea at which time she had very rapid atrial fibrillation
somehow having come off amiodarone completely.  Was in significant heart failure
and her medications were adjusted.

She is not doing well.  Her primary complaint is severe night sweats the last
several days.
She has had no focal symptoms of infection.
She has a chronic minor cough still from her last admission but this is slowly
going away.
She complains of exertional dyspnea -- winded with just five steps -- and
occasional lightheadedness.

History, assessment, and plan for all problems reviewed today are documented
below by problem.
Medication list above (reflecting any changes made today) has been reviewed for
accuracy with the patient.
Review of systems negative except as otherwise noted -- details of review may be
found in the paper record.
---

PROBLEM-FOCUSED HISTORY, ASSESSMENT, & PLAN.
GENL - on examination today she is actually overdiuresed with low blood
pressure, low jugular veins, and her complaint of lightheadedness.  Her dyspnea
must be pulmonary.  She will be seeing Dr. Weiss the day after tomorrow and I
suspect he will want a chest x-ray.  Her atrial fibrillation is rapid and I
think part of that is compensatory.
>>  blood work today including sedimentation rate, digoxin level
>>  discontinue Lasix today and tomorrow -- restart the next day 80 mg in the
morning WITHOUT her 40 mg afternoon dosage
>>  seeing Dr. Weiss in two days
>>  return here in 2-3 weeks

VASOSPASM - this was an issue for which she was given Tiazac February 1999,
taken off Tamoxifen temporarily and then restarted on Tamoxifen by her
oncologist shortly after.  The vasospasm resolved and tiazac was ultimately
discontinued.  She remained off tamoxifen and off diltiazem without significant
vasospasm -- but Tiazac was restarted to help with rate control in atrial
fibrillation.

AFIB - she has had asymptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is on
Coumadin both for this condition and for her hypercoagulable state.
Controlling her paroxysmal fibrillation has been challenging. She has had side
effects from multiple beta-blockers including exacerbation of her vasospasm
(tingling and cold extremities) with nadolol most recently. The combination of
amiodarone, digoxin, and Tiazac has been insufficient to give good control
overall.  We have given her verapamil in the past and this might be another
arrow to consider utilizing.

Early August 20, EKG in sinus rhythm and very very well-controlled with nadolol
but with side effects mandating return to carvedilol.
Holter monitor on carvedilol, choroid, amiodarone , digoxin, diltiazem September
2004 shows average heart rate 80 ranging 53-156 with sinus rhythm and 2 long
runs of atrial fibrillation running from 100 up to about 150 beats per minute
without any symptoms.

Clearly, September 2004, although she would like to come off some of her
medicines she actually needed more medication for rate control. Given her
history of side effects there was no very good answer. Dr. Levinson added
verapramil SR 120mg per day to her diltiazem September 2004 and today she is
feeling significantly better with more energy. Today's EKG is afib/flutter with
an improved ventricular rate of approximately 90bpm. I will not increase
verapramil and discontinue diltiazem today as had been the plan outlined by Dr.
Levinson in order to tidy up her calcium channel blocker program -- as she is
having some constipation but it is relatively mild and under control with diet.
I did not order a repeat holter today to assess her rate control given her EKG
information today and how well she is feeling overall.
>>  continue current program without change
>>  RTC 6 months -- sooner as needed

CARDIOMYOPATHY - Adriamycin cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction initially
approximately 30-35 percent in 1997 by outside study and then improving to about
40 percent in 1998. She did well until her DIC in April 2002 when her ejection
fraction plummeted to 15 percent. Before discharge in early May her ejection
fraction was up to 27 percent with laminar thrombus noted. Repeat echocardiogram
August 2002 revealed further improvement of ejection fraction  back up to 45
percent.  She was well until late November 2003 when she developed an URI
leading to hospitalization early December with biventricular heart failure, EF
dropped to 18 percent.
Repeat echocardiogram December 2003 with ejection fraction up to 27 percent.
Repeat echocardiogram March 2000 for ejection fraction 30 and internal dimension
now top normal and definitely smaller than before.
Most recent echocardiogram March 2004 with ejection fraction of 30 and stable.
>>  we will repeat her echocardiogram before long


DIC - DIC April and May 2002 with multiple pulmonary and other emboli presumably
on the basis of tamoxifen as an extensive search for malignancy was completely
negative. She continues on warfarin being managed by MGH ACC.

HYPERTENSION - too low on her current program probably volume depletion

LIPIDS - no new data
>> fasting full labs including lipids and other labs today

NEURO -- Her chief complaint September 2004 was that she could not write, that
her balance was unsteady, she could not hold a cup of liquid or pour without
spilling, that she was dropping things and bumping into walls. She described a
tremor. This had been going on for a while and it was bilateral. She had no
other neurological symptoms. No tinnitus or anything like that. Thyroid hormone
and digoxin levels recently were okay. No changes in her medical program. Her
examination was unremarkable neurologically or for tremor. I do not know what
this is. I do not think it is one of her medications. She followed up with Dr.
Weiss in November 2004 and it had essentially resolved.
Today she tells me these neuro symptoms come and go to a mild degree without
pattern -- fine today.

 FINDINGS: 

 There is cardiomegaly. 

 The liver is heterogenous in attenuation and there is thickening 

 of the gallbladder wall, which measures 6 mm. These findings may 

 be seen in the setting of ischemia. There is trace perihepatic 

 ascites. 

 There is segmental thickening of the ascending colon that ends at 

 the hepatic flexure, most likely secondary to ischemic colitis. 

 Infectious colitis would be a less likely consideration. 

 There is no evidence of obstruction. 

 There is extensive descending and sigmoid colon diverticulosis. 

 No evidence for diverticulitis. 

 The celiac, SMA and IMA are patent. 

 The spleen is normal in size and configuration. There is no 

 intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy. 

 The kidneys enhance symmetrically. No focal renal lesions are 

 identified. No hydronephrosis is noted. 

 The pancreas, adrenals, soft tissues and bones are unremarkable. 

 There is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis. 

 There is a small right pleural effusion. Dependent changes are 

 noted at both lung bases. 

IMPRESSION 

 Colitis affecting the descending colon to the hepatic flexure, 

 most likely secondary to ischemia. No evidence for obstruction. 

 Heterogeneous attenuation to the liver, with thickening of the 

 gallbladder wall, that can also be seen in the setting of 

 ischemia. 

 Diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis. 


Type: Ultr, Abdomen 

Date/Time: 06/17/2005 04:37 PM 


 Findings: There is significant asymmetric wall thickening in the 

 gallbladder, measuring up to 7 mm thick. There is a sonographic 

 Murphy's sign. There is no evidence of gallbladder sludge or 

 stones. There is no pericholecystic fluid. 

 There is no evidence of intra- or extra- hepatic ductal 

 dilatation. The liver has normal echo texture. The common bile 

 duct measures 3 mm, which is normal. 

 The spleen measures 7.6 cm. The left kidney measures 10.9 cm. 

 There is a duplex left kidney. The right kidney measures 10.7 cm. 

 The pancreas is not well visualized due to overlying bowel gas. 

IMPRESSION 

 Asymmetric gallbladder wall thickening measuring up to 7 mm. The 

 differential diagnosis includes chronic inflammation or neoplasm. 

 Positive sonographic Murphy sign, without evidence of gallstones, 

 sludge or pericholecystic fluid. 


Flex sigmoidoscopy in 2003 with large-mouthed diverticulae 


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 

The patient is a 55 year old female with three weeks of intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, distension and diarrhea or bloody diarrhea. All occurring in setting of recent rapid a-fib with asymptomatic hypotension. Suspect low grade ischemia over last several weeks as a cause of abdominal symptoms. LFT rise is acute and in-hospital. 


1. Colitis - agree with CT read, likely ischemic. Stool cultures negative, less likely IBD. With recent history of recurrent hypotension, symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, elevated wbc and nausea typical symptoms. Agree with current management - antibiotics, bowel rest, fluids and attempts to maintain systolic BP. No need to pursue colonoscopy for diagnosis, but would need if symptoms fail to resolve as expected. 


2. LFTs- slight elevation on admission but principal rise after first hospital days. History of normal LFTS early this year so this is an acute hepatocellular injury. Given CT read and AST>ALT, suspect that low flow state is contributing to abnormal LFTs. Another culprit is the amiodarone, which was loaded for a-fib in the ER. If LFTs continue to rise after hemodynamics controlled, would discontinue amiodarone and consider another agent. Now also on cephalosporin, which can cause transaminitis, but this was started later. No clinical evidence for cholecystitis as cause of abnormal LFTs. On antibiotics regardless. Low likelihood acute viral hepatitis. Follow LFTs daily.

 79 yo male with HTN, HLD, Bladder CA, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma S/P excision '05, CAD S/P CABG X 6 '03 with progressive DOE/exertional chest tightness and CHF sxs since Dec.

In Dec he developed an episode of severe SOB following brisk exertion. It was associated with chest pressure from shoulder-to-shoulder that was relieved by belching. He went to a local ER where he ruled out. An echo there showed EF 20-25%. He saw his cardiologist, Dr Block, who arranged for a nuc ETT which showed an EF of 37% and no ischemia at a low workload (5 METS) and MPHR of 80%. His ACE/B-Bl were increased. He was instructed to check his BP weekly and to call with any change in sxs.

Meanwhile, 3 weeks ago he took a road trip to Louisiana during which he developed progressive DOE, bilat LE edema, exertional chest tightness and orthopnea, at times having to sleep in a recliner. 

He cut his trip short and saw Dr. Block last week. His BNP was elevated and CXR c/w mild edema. His Lasix and KCl were increased and arrangements made for him to be admitted today for IV diuresis and cath.

He has orthopnea when placed in prone position, but currently denies CP or SOB at rest.

Hasan Bazari, MD

Dear Hasan, 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. David Baker yesterday in Cardiac Unit Associates. I saw Mr. Baker on a semi-urgent basis because of dyspnea on exertion. I last saw Mr. Baker about a month ago just before he embarked on a road trip to Louisiana. He was well on the drive down. However, a couple of days later, after a big meal, he began to experience frequent belching. This symptom was worse when he lay down and was associated with shortness of breath. Sitting up led to an improvement in his dyspnea. He experience difficulty swallowing and was able to tolerate only soft solids. After 3 days of symptoms, the patient went to the local hospital. His blood pressure was 150/60. He was told that he did not have a MI. The diagnosis of GERD or hiatal hernia was made and prevacid and peptobismol were prescribed. Prevacid and peptobismol helped the gi symptoms, but the shortness of breath is getting worse particularly when he goes out into the cold or walks up a flight of stairs. The patient's dyspnea is associated with a band-like chest discomfort. The patient also noted that he was "retaining"--pedal edema. 

The patient's other medications include lisinopril 40 mg po qd, lopressor 75 mg po bid, lipitor 20 mg po qd, lasix 20 mg po qd, aspirin 81 mg po qd, and zantac 75 mg po qd. 

On physical examination, Mr. Baker did not appear to be in distress. His pulse was 90 with frequent skipped beats. His blood pressure was 140/70. His JVP was ~ 5-10. He had a clearly audible high-pitched II/VI murmur at the apex. There were no abdominal bruits or organomegaly. There was 2+ pedal edema. The murmur was more marked than in the past, and the pedal edema was new. 

Laboratory data was notable for BUN 23, creatinine 0.9, and potassium 3.0. NT-proBNP was 2733. HCT was 40.4, wbc was 10.1, and platelets were 253. PT-INR was 17.4. LFTs were normal, but BILT was increased at 1.4. ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm with frequent multifocal VEA, left atrial enlargement, and left bundle branch block. CXR revealed mild interstitial pulmonary edema, moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, and pleural disease. The latter two are unchanged. 

My impression is that Mr. Baker has congestive heart failure likely due to coronary artery disease and LV systolic dysfunction. It is possible that his CHF is a manifestation of progressive CAD. Despite absence of myocardial ischemia on his ETT-mibi in December, I think it is most prudent to undertake cardiac catheterization to exclude a reversible etiology. In the interim, I asked Mr. Baker to increase his lasix to 40 mg po qd. I recommended KCl 40 mEq today and 20 mEQ thereafter. Prior to cath next week, I will arrange to recheck electrolytes, PT-INR, and PTT. 

After Mr. Baker's cardiac cath, it may well be appropriate to ask the patient to see a gastroenterologist to evaluate his dysphagia.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if I may provide any additional information. 

Sincerely, 

Ken

Dear Hasan, 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. David Baker in Cardiac Unit Associates on February 5. I saw Mr. Baker in follow-up of his hospitalization at Brockton Hospital in December for acute onset dyspnea. Mr. Baker indicated that he has not had any recurrence of his symptoms since I last saw him in January. He denied chest pain or palpitations. He has not been measuring his blood pressure at home. The patient underwent a Holter monitor on January 10. The results were notable for only frequent VEA with a 15 beat run at a rate of 99 and a 5 beat run at a rate of 194. His current medications include lisinopril 40 mg po qd, lasix 20 mg po qd, aspirin 81 mg po qd, lipitor 40 mg po qd, metoprolol 50 mg po bid, and ranitidine 75 mg po qd. 

On physical examination, Mr. Baker's pulse was 72, and there were multiple skipped beats. His blood pressure was 150/60. Lungs were clear. There were no carotid bruits, and there was no JV distension. There was a I-II/VI early systolic murmur best heard over the apex. There were active bowel sounds without organomegaly. Posterior tibialis pulses were 1+. There was no pedal edema. Laboratory data was notable for BUN 13, creatinine 0.9, normal electrolytes, LDL 63, and HDL 42. An ECG revealed sinus arrhythmia, left atrial enlargement, 1st AVB, and left bundle branch block. This ECG was not markedly different than past ECGs with the exception of sinus arrhythmia. 

I do not have an explanation for Mr. Baker's episode of dyspnea. Although ventricular ectopic activity was noted on his Holter monitor, his LVEF remains higher than the usual threshold for an ICD. However, I did recommend an increase in his lopressor to 75 mg po bid (for his hypertension). I plan to see Mr. Baker again in 6 months. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I may provide any additional information. 

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Pinkerton: 


Mr. Azzi came in for his ICD implant today.  We were able to position a coronary sinus lead to overlie the lateral aspect of the left ventricle where there was reasonable capture threshold.  We gave him a St. Jude medical CRT-D device and programmed for pacing between 50 and 130 beats per minute to provide adequate cardiac resynchronization therapy.  He has ventricular fibrillation therapy programmed for rates above 214 beats per minute.  There is a monitor zone between 150 and 214 beats per minute. 


He is expected to go home tomorrow after the device check proves satisfactory, and I will see him back in the clinic for a followup visit in the next few weeks. 


Many thanks again for letting me be involved in his care. 


With kindest regards. 


Yours sincerely,

Dear Dr. Pinkerton: 


I had the pleasure of meeting Victor Azzi who as you know is a retired professor at UNC, currently doing consultation work in engineering. 


Following a period of increasing fatigue and shortness of breath, he presented to the Portsmouth Regional Hospital in March this year with increasing shortness of breath and was in congestive heart failure on presentation.  An echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% to 20% with normal coronary angiography. His 12-lead ECG also showed evidence for a wide left bundle-branch block with a QRS duration of 174 milliseconds.  He was treated with diuretics and vasodilators and improved dramatically and was finally discharged home on carvedilol 3.125 mg twice daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, and spironolactone.  The spironolactone was subsequently discontinued because of increasing potassium levels.  Since discharge from hospital, he has been doing cardiac rehabilitation and has regained much of his exercise tolerance, although he gets short of breath on more than moderate activity.  He is okay walking on the level at an easy pace but hurrying can make him short of breath.  He denies any orthopnea, or PND at the present time.  His NYHA class level can best be described as being between 2 and 3.  He has no peripheral edema.  He has not had any syncope or dizziness. 


His only past medical history is that of hypertension for which he has been treated with ACE inhibitors for the past 10 years.  There is some mention of documentation of left bundle-branch block along the way, although the exact time of documentation of this conduction abnormality is unclear. 


An echocardiogram performed in June of this year in Newington shows left ventricular dilatation with end-diastolic dimension of 6.1, end-systolic dimension of 5.4, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% to 20% with global hypokinesis and dyssynchronous septal motion.  Left atrium was 3.2 cm in diameter.  There was mild aortic sclerosis, but the other valves were normal with mild mitral regurgitation. 


His medications were as listed as above. 


He has no known drug allergies. 


He used to be extremely active, traveling frequently for work, although now he has curbed some of his activities.  He is a nonsmoker and drinks about 1 glass of wine per week. 


His family history, his mother died at the age of 90 from congestive heart failure, having had hypertension and a pacemaker implantation.  His father died at the age of 74 from some form of malignancy.  He has 3 brothers, one of whom died at the age of 68 from hepatitis.  Two of his brothers have a history of hypertension.  There is no family history of sudden cardiac death or cardiomyopathy. 


Today's clinical examination revealed him to be well appearing without anemia, lymphadenopathy, or jaundice.  Peripheral pulses are equal bilaterally.  There is no peripheral edema.  Venous pressure was normal.  He was in sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 64, blood pressure was 120/70 in the left arm.  Heart sounds are normal, and lung fields are clear.  Abdominal examination was negative, and there were no gross neurological abnormality. 


His 12-lead ECG confirms sinus rhythm, shows a PR interval of 170 milliseconds.  He has wide left bundle-branch block with a QRS duration of 174 milliseconds.  QTc is 518 milliseconds.  Heart rate is 60 beats per minute. 


In conclusion, this 80-year-old gentleman who is extremely active and still working professionally has evidence for a nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with left bundle-branch block and severe LV dysfunction, which has not improved with medical therapy for a period of  over 3 months.  Given his persistent symptoms and wide left bundle-branch block, he would clearly benefit from cardiac resynchronization to improve ventricular function and prevent further episodes of congestive heart failure.  I have also explained to him that cardiac resynchronization is probably best provided in the form of a defibrillator.  Given that he is otherwise very viable and active, a defibrillator would reduce his risk of sudden cardiac death.  Once we have a CRT device in place, we should be able to make improvements in his medical therapy by increasing his carvedilol and possibly even reinstituting spironolactone a lower dose if renal function improves with cardiac resynchronization. 


After a long discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, I will arrange for him to be admitted in the next few weeks for his implantation.  He understands that adequate left ventricular pacing may not be possible in some patients in which case he would be a candidate for consideration of surgical LV lead placement given his class I indication for CRT. 


Once again, many thanks for letting me be involved in his care. 


I will of course get back in touch with you once I have further information. 


With kindest regards. 


Yours sincerely,

Pt's wife Patient's Thoughts about VAD/Transplant: Unable to assess patient's feelings about VAD or transplant.  Patient's wife says that while she does not think that her husband would want to be supported by machines in the hospital with no hope for meaningful recovery or without the possibility to go home, she does believe that he would want the chance to go home with a BiVAD.  Pt's wife and family currently have a limited understanding about VAD but his sister-in-law, Marianne, has done some research online and is asking appropriate questions about VAD caregiving and limitations. She is also somewhat informed already about potential risks and complications of durable mechanical support  Pt's wife says that she knows going home with a VAD would be a "big adjustment" and she feels that pt will eventually be able to cope well as long as it means that he gets to go home and is able to do things like be in his garden, ride in a car, do jigsaw puzzles and spend time with his family.  Pt's wife understands that the Centrimag BiVAD is a temporary device and that her husband has a long way to go before he may be able to have a more durable device implanted and possibly be listed for transplant. She says "He has to have liver and kidney recovery and be able to get off of the breathing machine.  Then he has to be up and walking around before they'll do another surgery." She feels that he would want the chance to go home, even with a VAD, and says that she thinks that he will be strongly motivated to "do what he has to" to get there.  She, the patient, and other family will benefit from additional education about the BiVAD and transplant should patient progress to those points.

SW provided education around potential for anxiety and/or depression when pt wakes up and with the BiVAD and transplant.

Environmental Supports:[X]Access to Reliable Transportation[X]Stable Housing[X]Use of Eye Glasses, Hearing Aids, or Mobility Devices: Assessment 

Narrative:  

SW met w/ patient's wife, Brenda, and sister-in-law, Marianne, in the SH 2nd floor family waiting area to provide support and to complete psychosocial assessment as part of VAD/transplant evaluation.  Pt is currently  in the OR receiving a Centrimag BiVAD and is unable to participate in the interview.  It is not likely that he will be able to participate for some time.  Pt's wife describes a strong support system for pt that consists of herself, pt's daughter Missy, pt's niece Trisha, pt's sister-in-law Marianne, and siblings. Pt has 9 siblings who can offer varying degrees of support for things like transportation, VAD caregiving, and household tasks.  Brenda feels that many of these people will want to be involved in pt's post-discharge care and will want to participate in VAD education. 


SW and family discussed what they believe patient's desires would be and both agree that he would want the opportunity to go home, even if it was on a machine like a BiVAD.  Brenda states that patient would do "anything to get home" and she believes that he would adjust and cope will with the limitations and lifestyle adjustments that come with MCS at home. She says that she does not believe that patient would want to be sustained by machines in the hospital if there was no realistic possibility that he would eventually go home. She describes him as a willful and motivated person who "does what he has to do." Brenda and Marianne have some understanding about VAD based on their own research and were asking many appropriate questions about the caregiving required and the social impact of living with a device.  They would benefit from additional education when appropriate.  Brenda clearly understands that pt is critically ill and may not become a candidate for durable VAD or transplant and says that she is 
"taking it day by day" but is trying to stay positive. She is coping well with the support of her sister in law.  


SW will continue to meet with family and hopefully patient to continue to assess for needs, coping and supports. Will also continue to assess pt's motivation to pursue advanced therapies if appropriate and encourage discussions around advance directives when pt able to participate. 


Strengths: supportive family, per wife pt has motivations to pursue advanced therapies if offered

Quality of Support: pt appears to have strong support from his family. 

Concerns: pt's wife is concerned that he will be unable to receive a durable device to go home with. She is also concerned that he may not be a transplant candidate.

Specific Hopes/Fears: Pt's wife hopes that his liver and kidneys will recover and that pt will be able to participate in care so that he has the opportunity to go home.

Assessment of potential recipients' ability to adhere to therapeutic regimens: per wife's report pt may have good compliance potential.

Pt's current understanding of potential risks/benefits/responsibilities of VAD:  minimal understanding at this point.  Will need more education. Family is eager and willing to learn more about VAD and transplant when appropriate. 


SW concerns as they relate to advanced therapies include: unable to meet with pt at this time to assess his thoughts and concerns regarding VAD and transplant.  Unable to assess pt coping skills, thoughts on quality of life and mental stability. Will need to re-assess when pt able to participate. No major concerns based on wife's report. Would want to meet with other support people as well.


Patient Interventions/Education:

Reviewed chart, introduced self to pt family, described role of SW on the cardiac transplant and VAD team.

Provided education around the potential emotional impact and psychological aspects of transplantation including increased stress, anxiety, depression, guilt, etc.

Discussed the potential risks and benefits of VAD/transplant including the need for lifelong medication and routine follow up at BWH (and need for transportation to clinic appointments and procedures).

Assessed pt family's understanding of the risk/benefits/responsibilities of advanced therapies and addressed pt's questions and concerns about the VAD/transplant process.

Gathered psychosocial information pertaining to pt's ability to comply with a complicated medical regimen in the post-transplant period as much as possible given that the pt is in the OR and will be intubated/sedated for several days post-op.

Assessed pt's coping abilities PER FAMILY REPORT and strategies and provided emotional support to pt family around the stress and fears associated with advanced therapies.

Discussed the non-medical expenses (transportation to and from BWH, lodging, meals, parking) associated with VAD/transplant.

Encouraged family to follow-up w/ PFR about parking validation and/or vouchers.   

SW provided pt with copies of:SW contact information; encouraged pt to call, e-mail or page with any additional questions or concerns. SW encouraged family to discuss HCP and advanced directives with pt when able.BWH Guidelines for a family member staying at bedsideCaring Bridge pamphletTransplant fund raising informationParking Assistance Form (for vouchers through PFR)Information about what is expected of Support Network during VAD/transplant processPlan

Date/Time of Visit: 10/15/13 1400


Source/Reason for Referral: SW initiated referral to support family.  Pt currently on ECMO with possible need for BiVAD in the future. All information obtained from his wife and sister-in-law because pt is intubated and sedated. Social History 

Living/family situation and support system: Mr. Gilbert "Gil" Arundale is a 66 y/o married male who lives with his wife Brenda in Pawtuckett, RI.  Brenda reports that she and pt have been  married for 44 years and that they have a close and supportive relationship.  Their adult daughter, Melissa, lives next door to them with her 12 and 9 y/o sons.  Pt was heavily involved in the care of his grandchildren before they started elementary school and continued to be involved in their care as needed until admission.  In addition to his wife and daughter, pt is supported by 9 brothers and sisters as well as in-laws.  Per his wife he "is one of the middle of 10 siblings." Brenda is accompanied today by her sister-in-law Marianne who reports that most of patient's siblings live in the area except for 3 and that all of the siblings are supportive of one another.  


Work/educational status: Pt's wife reports that pt served in the Navy for 4 years and was a police officer for 25 years before retiring. He most recently worked at The Home Depot. 


Financial/Insurance issues: Pt's wife denies any current financial or insurance concerns. Per LMR pt has Medicare part A only and will need thorough financial coordinator evaluation if considered for transplant. 


Brief history of current health status: Per LMR: 

-          CAD

-          MI with PCI (3 stents) (2004)

-          MI with PCI (1 stent) (2006)

-          BiV ICD placed (2011)

-          HTN

-          HLD


Patient/Family's understanding of diagnosis: Patient's wife appears to have an appropriate understanding of pt's current condition and possible treatment options saying, "they are going to do an echo today and see if he is a candidate for the VAD." Her knowledge of VAD is understandably limited and SW provided some basic education with emphasis on need for social supports. 


Patient/Family's goals of care:  Pt's wife feels that he would want "any chance to go home, even if he has to have a machine or batteries." She is clear that he would not want to be sustained as he is currently if there was no hope for reasonable recovery or the opportunity to go home. She describes pt as a "giving" man who devoted the last several years of his police career to the community service department where he taught D.A.R.E. classes in local schools.  She says that he is "mostly a homebody" now who enjoys spending time with his grandchildren and other family, "puttering" in the garden, and doing small home projects.  


Mental health history: Pt's wife denies any knowledge of a mental health history. 


Alcohol/tobacco/substance history: Per pt's wife and sister in law he quit smoking at age 30.  Rarely drinks. 


Abuse/DV history: Unable to assess 2/2 pt sedation and intubation. 


Advanced Directives/HC Proxy: none noted in chart. Pt's wife says that she thinks they have paperwork at home. 


Other risks and concerns: none at this time

 Assessment 

Narrative: SW met with patient's wife and sister-in-law in pt's cardiac surgery ICU room.  Pt's wife, Brenda, is receptive to SW visit and easily engaged in discussion.  She reports feeling overwhelmed by pt's current medical status but hopeful that he may be able to recover to the point of going home on mechanical support. She is well supported by her family as well as the patient's family members.  She appears to have a good understanding of pt's current condition and is clear that while he would not want to be sustained on life support in the hospital, he would want the chance to go home with mechanical support if possible. She says that he is a highly motivated person who enjoys spending time with his family and working on small projects around the house and she feels that if he could return to that he would want to, even on mechanical support. She is eager to find out what his echo results are and what pt's treatment plan is going forward.

Discussed pt with RN

Educated pt's family on role of SW in hospital setting and provided contact information

Compared with the prior study there has been a 
significant change. Left ventricular ejection fraction is severely reduced 
at 15%. The left atrium is partially compressed by an echogenic density in 
the pericardium (may represent a haematoma). The right heart is not seen and 
may be either decompressed by ECMO or there may be thrombus present.

Plan per primary team is for possible BiVAD vs LVAD in upcoming days.  


1. AKI - likely multifactorial from ATN from persistent hypotension and may have small component of rhabdomyolysis now still requiring pressors and remains critically ill. Currently still making excellent UOP and Cr has yet to have plateau'ed.  

- Although volume overloaded patient is making nearly 150-200cc/hr and does not appear to have any acute indication for RRT 

- pressor requirements have been improving over past 24 hours, but is still unclear as to how much dysfunction patient's right heart may have and his repeat echo will be important as he may not be able to tolerate much net negative volume removal 

- at this point would titrate Lasix gtt and add diuril as needed to attempt to achieve net even to slightly net negative balance today 


**Volume - hypervolemic w/ elevated LFTs and bilirubin which is likely acute liver injury from hypotension but volume overload may be contributing 

- as above would titrate lasix gtt and diuril to achieve net even to slightly net negative 


**Lytes - K at 4.4

Staff Addendum: 

I saw and examind this patient with Dr. Srivastava.  I agree fully with his outlined exam, assesment and plan.   UA without evidence of ATN which is a good sign that there may be limitted tubular damage and good prognsosis for recovery despite  case hx strongly consistent with ATN superimposed on pre-renal state. 

Plan-now responding to diuretics. Observe for today, maximize hemodynamics, dose meds for eGFR<10. We will continue to follow and evaluate daily.

Dear Dr. Cannistra: 


I saw your patient, Mr. Arundale, in my office today for a 30-minute consultation regarding aortic valve replacement, half of which was spent with him and his wife discussing the underlying pathology, the various management options, and particularly the surgical one along with its risks and complications.   


Mr. Arundale is a 66-year-old retired policeman who had longstanding history of coronary artery disease where he had a myocardial infarction in 2004 and then in 2006, and he had a total of 4 stent placements.  He also had biventricular pacemaker/defibrillator in 2011 for poor left ventricular function.  Now, he continues to be asymptomatic; however, his left ventricle is dilating in the setting of moderate-to-severe aortic incompetence.  His last cardiac catheterization was done in 2006.  He has an estimated ejection fraction of 20%-25%.  He has well-preserved left ventricular function with normal pulmonary artery pressures.  


He has a past medical history of hypercholesterolemia and a family history of coronary artery disease.  


He is ALLERGIC TO LISINOPRIL, which gives him a cough, and also to CONTRAST DYE, which gives him hives.   


His medications include Lipitor, aspirin, digoxin, Coreg, and Lasix.   


On examination, he has a heart rate of 84 per minute, regular, blood pressure 145/82.  His weight is 190 pounds.  He has normal heart sounds with a diastolic murmur of aortic origin.  He has a clear chest.  No sounds of congestive heart failure.  He has no varicose veins and no peripheral edema.   


Mr. Arundale has increasingly dilating left ventricle with moderate-to-severe aortic incompetence.  I have advised him to undergo aortic valve replacement.  The operation and the risks involved were carefully explained to him, and he wishes to proceed.  He would like to have an epicardial valve as his replacement device.   


I would like to thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this gentleman.  If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to call. 


Sincerely,

Dear Len,

John Jones underwent successful and uncomplicated implantation of a CRTD system today to assist in the management of his atrial arrhythmias and progressively advancing systolic heart failure.  I attempted to perform a retrograde coronary venogram from the right femoral approach, which is my usual routine.  However, this was unsuccessful because I could not engage the coronary sinus ostium using this approach due to massive right atrial enlargement.

Right ventricular and right atrial lead positioning were uncomplicated.  I was able to cannulate the coronary sinus from the left superior approach using an axillary vein puncture; the ostium was unusually low and again because of right atrial enlargement, I had some difficulty advancing a guide sheath deep within the coronary sinus.  A retrograde venogram from the left superior approach demonstrated 2 target veins serving the basal free wall of the left ventricle; they had take off points that were almost at the junction of the main body coronary sinus and the anterior coronary vein.  I was able to easily cannulate the first of these 2 branches, where a mechanically stable site was identified yielding a capture threshold of about 0.2 milliseconds/3 volts and no evidence of extracardiac stimulation at 10 volts output, which is an acceptable set of pacing parameters for a patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

The remainder of the procedure went uneventfully.  We did not induce ventricular fibrillation because of his atrial fibrillation and suspension of anticoagulation and because of his heart failure clinical status.

I anticipate that we will initiate all of his medications this evening including his Coumadin.

He became a little bit restless during the procedure having received only a tiny amount of intravenous conscious sedation because of his sleep apnea and his heart failure status.  At one point, we had to struggle little bit to keep him on the table, but this situation lifted within about 20 minutes time and at the end of the procedure, he was awake and alert and his usual self.

I personally reviewed his progress with his wife before and after the procedure.

I anticipated an overnight stay and I will arrange to see him in followup at the Faulkner.

We will have to make a decision what to do next.  I did implant a triple chamber system and an attempt at restoring sinus rhythm assisted by Dofetilide despite the amiodarone failure might be worth it.  If that is ineffectual, then we could contemplate catheter ablation of the AV junction rendering him functionally or truly pacemaker dependent and giving up on AV synchrony altogether, but gaining definitive ventricular rate control.  Another option would be catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in the left atrium (pulmonary vein isolation), which is being advocated in some patients with advancing systolic heart failure, but it is a procedure that does have some measurable risk and it could be particularly challenging because of its duration (4-6 hours lying flat on his back) in heart failure.

In any event, we will see him together over at the Faulkner and sort things out.

Sincerely,

Dear Len,

Thanks for sending John Jones to see me today for consideration of device therapy in the context of chronic established ischemic cardiomyopathy and permanent atrial arrhythmias.  I spent about 45 minutes with he and his wife today discussing his situation with particular attention to how you might high help him live longer and potentially feel better with electrical therapies.

A 76 years old, he has chronic ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia and 10 years ago had bypass surgery at the Brigham by Dr. Aranki.  At least up to 2006, his bypass grafts were patent and his systolic function was normal at 50% though he had mild septal hypokinesia.  However, in 09/2008, he presented with what I believe was his first episode of volume overload heart failure, unaccompanied by elevated biomarkers, and a significant decline in left ventricular pump function with an ejection fraction in the range of 25-30%.  He had nuclear imaging study, which disclosed a new inferior defect compatible with loss of a bypass graft but repeat coronary angiography was not entertained.  He is therefore referred primarily for consideration of ICD therapy for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death.

Additionally, it appears as though he developed atrial fibrillation in 2007; the last ECG which he was in sinus rhythm was in 03/2006 whereas the next ECG in 04/2007, he was in atrial fibrillation.  He had been treated with amiodarone ineffectively for maintenance of sinus rhythm and therefore this strategy was eventually abandoned in favor of rate control alone.  He was transiently hypothyroid while receiving amiodarone, but evidently that has come under good control.

He has done reasonably well over the past several months with no recurrent hospitalizations or urgent care visits for heart failure.

His current medications are Coumadin, Lasix 120/80, Toprol-XL 50 mg b.i.d., TriCor 145 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, Synthroid 100 mcg daily, potassium 20 mEq daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, insulin, Zoloft, vitamin D, Zantac, and calcium.

He is supposedly allergic to penicillin.

He has in tolerances of inhibitors and ARBs, which cause angioedema, and amiodarone, which cause hypothyroidism and failed to maintain sinus rhythm.

His 12-lead electrocardiograms are interesting.  In 03/2006 when he was last recorded to be in sinus rhythm, there was evidence of a massive anterior infarct with no dominant R wave or even an echophrasic RS in any precordial lead.  Additionally, limb lead voltage was very low, and every lead under 10 millivolts and mostly is under 5 millivolts.  At that time, there was no evidence of inferior myocardial infarction.  The next ECG from 04/2007 shows the exact same ventricular conduction pattern except in the context of atrial fibrillation.  The most recent ECG from 01/2009 is notable now for the development of inferior QS complexes and an increase in negative voltage compatible with inferior myocardial infarction.  His QRS duration is 116 milliseconds.

He has a chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy, bypass surgery, and recent decline in ventricular function that can be attributed to a new inferior myocardial infarction probably the loss of the right coronary artery graft.  Despite this, noninvasive imaging discloses no evidence of residual ischemia and therefore coronary angiography or repeat interventional bypass surgery is not on the table.

He does qualify for primary prevention ICD therapy.  I discussed this with him and his wife in careful detail.  I discussed the scientific basis for this recommendation as well as the rationale, risk, benefits, and alternatives which are essentially none.  I talked about this as the implantation procedure in some detail including the risks mentioned to involve bleeding, bruising, infection, collapsed lung, perforated heart, stroke, shock, and death.  We also discussed some of the difficulties of followup including lead or pulse generator advisories or alerts, inappropriate therapies, the need for long-term monitoring, and periodic office visits.

A conventional ICD will not improve his ventricular function at all and will not make him feel any better, but may save his life.  He does not qualify for cardiac resynchronization therapy as he does not have a significant ventricular conduction delay.  Additionally, that pattern of anterior and inferior myocardial infarction even in the presence of left bundle-branch block, which strongly argue against any chance of significant improvement in function.

On the other hand, if his ventricular rate control during atrial fibrillation is contributing to his reduced pump function then catheter ablation of the AV junction followed biventricular pacing might help him.  In this case, a left ventricular pacing lead in a biventricular configuration would be recommended, so that obligatory ventricular pacing after catheter ablation yields a closer approximation of a normal ventricular activation sequence.  We discussed that in detail including the relative difficulties with left ventricular epicardial pacing.

Current strategy is to implant his ICD system next Wednesday at the Brigham.  Then, during followup we will make a determination as to whether there would be a desire for definitive rate control via catheter ablation.  With respect to his atrial arrhythmias, I suppose it would be debated whether we should implant an atrial lead because he is in permanent atrial fibrillation, and the only other drug we could try dofetilide.  Frankly if amiodarone was ineffective, there is essentially no chance of Dofetilide would be.  On the other hand, if his ventricular function improved after rate control during atrial fibrillation then restoration of sinus rhythm might be a reasonable possibility, so I would probably implant an atrial electrode.

I will discuss this with you before the procedure next week.  Thanks for having me see.  I enjoyed their company.

Sincerely,

Dear Jonathan: 


Mr. Jones came for cardiac reassessment following last week's Faulkner admission.  As you now, he is a 76-year-old man with coronary disease in the setting of diabetes and dyslipidemia who is now 10 years status post CABG.  Cardiac catheterization in 2006 showed patent grafts and his LVEF was 50% at that time, with mild septal hypokinesia.  In September 2008 he had presented with volume overload and a likely intercurrent silent IMI based on a new fixed inferior defect on scintigraphy, without elevated biomarkers.  His symptoms responded to diuresis.  He was also started on thyroid replacement therapy for an elevated TSH while on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.  The latter was discontinued as it failed to maintain sinus rhythm, after having done so until 2007. 


He was readmitted last week because of orthostatic lightheadedness with systolic pressures in the 80s, relative volume depletion and fatigue that was likely contributed to by Elavil which had been prescribed for neurogenic jaw pain.  While in hospital, he became more energetic off of the Elavil and his blood pressure improved with gentle hydration.  However, an updated echocardiogram showed that the left ventricular ejection fraction had declined to 25%, with inferior wall akinesia and anteroseptal hypokinesia.  MIBI scintigraphy again showed a large fixed inferior and apical defect without significant reversible ischemia.  His presenting heart rates were in the low 100s and improved with augmentation of metoprolol.  He had not experienced any recent angina and that has remained the case.  He did not tolerate ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in the past because of angioedema and during this hospitalization hydralazine plus isosorbide were considered, but not yet started because of his relatively low blood pressures. 


MEDICATIONS: 

1.  Warfarin, regulated through Brigham Anticoagulation Service. 

2.  Furosemide 120 mg in a.m., 80 mg in p.m. 

3.  Toprol XL 50 mg b.i.d. 

4.  TriCor 145 mg daily. 

5.  Lipitor 20 mg daily. 

6.  Synthroid 100 mcg daily. 

7.  K-Dur 20 mEq daily. 

8.  Insulin, Zoloft, vitamin D, Zantac, Rocaltrol. 

9.  Aspirin 81 mg daily. 


INTOLERANCE TO MEDICATIONS: 

1.  ACE inhibitor, ARB - angioedema. 

2.  Amiodarone - hypothyroidism and did not maintain sinus rhythm. 


On examination, he appears more energetic than at last week's hospitalization.  The blood pressure is 98/64, heart rate 90 and irregular, weight 233 pounds, oxygen saturation 95%.  The jugular venous pressure is 5.  The carotid upstrokes are symmetric and not delayed.  The chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows a grade II/VI early-peaking systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border.  There is no MR or S3.  The abdomen is soft, without hepatomegaly or tenderness.  There is no peripheral pitting edema. 


The electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of approximately 85.  There is leftward axis deviation and poor R wave progression across the precordium.  Inferior Q waves are present. 


In summary, Mr. Jones has: 

1.  CAD, status post CABG, 1999 (IMA to LAD, saphenous vein graft to RCA-OM1-OM2); cardiac catheterization, 2006, showed patent grafts.   In September 2008 he presented with volume overload, with evidence of a silent intercurrent IMI.  At last week's echo his LVEF had declined to 25%; MIBI showed fixed inferior and anteroapical defects without reversible ischemia.  He has not had any symptoms of angina.  ACE inhibitor and ARB therapies have not been added because of previous angioedema and his blood pressure has not allowed initiation of hydralazine plus nitrates.  He may be a candidate for ICD-CRT therapy and I will arrange for him to see Dr. Michael Sweeney for assessment in that regard.  Caveats are that underlying silent ischemia may be present despite the MIBI findings, and a preprocedure coronary angiogram may be in order.  In addition, at his recent presentation his ventricular rates were in the low 100s in atrial fibrillation and a tachycardia-induced contribution to decline in LV function is possible and a repeat echocardiogram would be prudent before we move forward with ICD implantation.   

2.  Permanent atrial fibrillation, now with better rate control. 

3.  Diabetes. 

4.  Dyslipidemia. 

5.  Sleep apnea, on CPAP. 

6.  Emphysema. 

7.  Likely lacunar TIA, 2006, without symptomatic recurrence. 


I appreciate the opportunity to participate in Mr. Jones' care. 


With kind regards, sincerely yours,

Dear Jon: 


Mr. Jones came for routine cardiac assessment today because of coronary disease and atrial fibrillation.  His wife and daughter accompanied him, and state that over the past couple of months his stamina has been poor and he spends much of the day sleeping.  He has not had any chest pain or shortness of breath but describes orthostatic lightheadedness, decreased appetite and about a 10-pound weight loss over the past month.  The dosage of Synthroid had been increased because of elevated TSH and the most recent value had improved at 7.3.  Last week the INR was excessive and the Anticoagulation Service has reduced his dose, with subsequent improvement. His wife believes that the Elavil, which had been prescribed for neurogenic jaw pain, has contributed to his sleepiness. 


MEDICATIONS: 

1.  Warfarin, regulated through Brigham Anticoagulation Service. 

2.  Furosemide 120 mg in a.m., 80 mg in p.m. 

3.  Toprol XL 25 mg daily. 

4.  TriCor 145 mg daily. 

5.  Lipitor 20 mg daily. 

6.  Synthroid 100 mcg daily. 

7.  K-Dur 20 mEq daily. 

8.  Insulin, Zoloft, vitamin D, Elavil. 


INTOLERANCE TO MEDICATIONS: 

1.  ACE inhibitor, ARB - angioedema. 

2.  Amiodarone - hypothyroidism and did not maintain sinus rhythm. 


On examination, he is in good spirits but appears fatigued.  The blood pressure is 86 systolic and then 93 systolic, weight 236 pounds, oxygen saturation 96%.  The jugular venous pressure is less than 5.  The carotid upstrokes are symmetric, without delay.  The chest is free of moist rales or wheezes.  Cardiac exam shows a grade II/VI early-peaking systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border.  There is no S3.  The abdomen is soft, without hepatomegaly or tenderness.  There is no peripheral pitting edema. 


The electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with controlled to moderate ventricular rate, leftward axis and intraventricular conduction delay with poor R wave progression consistent with prior anterior MI, similar to the tracing of October 15, 2008. 


In summary, Mr. Jones has: 

1.  CAD, status post CABG, 1999; cardiac catheterization, 2006, showed patent grafts and LVEF was approximately 50%, with mild septal hypokinesia.  In September 2008 he presented with volume overload and there may have been an intercurrent IMI based on a fixed inferior defect on scintigraphy.  His symptoms responded to diuretic therapy, but he now appears volume deplete, with reduced systolic pressure and fatigue.  His TSH was also as high as 18.4 recently but has improved to 7.3.  In light of likely volume depletion and hypotension, he is proceeding to the Emergency Department for further assessment and management.   It is likely that the Elavil will be tapered as off as a trial. 

2.  Permanent atrial fibrillation.  Once his blood pressure has normalized, reaugmentation of the metoprolol would likely be appropriate for better rate control. 

3.  Diabetes. 

4.  Dyslipidemia. 

5.  Sleep apnea, on CPAP. 

6.  Emphysema. 

7.  Likely lacunar TIA, 2006, without symptomatic recurrence.   


With kind regards, sincerely yours,

Dear Dr. Applebaum:

I saw Mr. Jones for followup neurological visit today.  This is a 76-year-old man whom I initially saw in late summer due to an atypical facial pain.  Initially, I increased his gabapentin to 600 mg a day, than it was in September, he had an inpatient evaluation here at Faulkner Hospital with shortness of breath and dyspnea.  During his stay, his team contacted me due to the fact gabapentin was not helpful for his pain and we switched him from gabapentin to amitriptyline and at that time to 50 mg.  He found that since he has been on amitriptyline, his pain disappears and only it was last week while he was eating salting crackers he had a very brief episodes of excruciating pain without any recurrence.  Interestingly looking at his records, he has a very significant hypothyroidism.  His TSH level up to 42 in June.  It is gradually coming down, last level being at 7.  He has a mild renal insufficiency and interestingly most recently his systolic blood pressure has been running in the 90s.  So metoprolol has been decreased from 100 to 75 mg a day.

I checked his blood pressure today, it is 82/60.  He tells me that the only complain he has is that he easily fall asleep during the day and wonders if it is the amitriptyline.  As I mentioned earlier, he is pain free at this point.

He has many contributing factors to his excessive daytime sleepiness.  I am sure he has his hypotension as well as hypothyroidism are contributing factor in addition to this sedative effect of amitriptyline.  Giving his opacity, he most likely has obstructive sleep apnea, which probably contributes to his complain.

All other systems were reviewed and negative and his exam remains nonfocal.

I am pleased that amitriptyline has been quite effective, again with aggressive treatment of his hypothyroidism and close monitoring of his blood pressure, hypotension is necessary, which probably contributes to his daytime sleepiness.  I scheduled him to see me in February, at which time I will be glad to decrease his amitriptyline to 40 mg.  I was hesitant to do so today as he had a recent breakthrough pain.

Sincerely,

Return Patient Visit 

Jones, John MR# 11184777 

December 1, 2008 


Interval History: 

Mr. Jones returns to Renal Clinic today for follow up with his CKD, which is most likely due to DM, microvascular disease and PAF. Mr. Jones was recently hospitalized for CHF in October. Following hospitalization, his Toprol XL was increased from 50mg daily to 75mg daily, then to 100mg daily for rate control of his PAF. His TSH increased from 14.84 to 18.4 in mid-October, and Synthroid was increased to 100mcg daily. 


In the last month, Mr. Jones has felt fatigued and sluggish with increased sleep. He has also noted decreased appetite with nausea and vomiting about 1-2 times a week, usually on an empty stomach, reminiscent of gastroparesis diagnosed several years prior. He experiences thirst and has maintained fluid intake with urine output of about 1.3-1.4 L/day,. His creatinine has increased from 1.74 in mid-September to 2.1 on 10/15/08. HbA1c was 9.1, last checked 9/18/08. 


He notes a sporadic cough in the last 1.5 months, especially on lying down, productive of thick gray sputum. He continues to have pain in his right knee and left shoulder from osteoarthritis. 


Problem list: 

CKD, CAD, status post CABG, 1999.  Cardiac catheterization 5/06, showed patent grafts. LVEF 50%, TIA 4/06, Paroxysmal AF, ? early dementia, ex-smoker. 


Medications: KCl 10meq bid, Metoprolol xl 50mg po bid, Lasix 120mg in am, 80mg in pm, Lipitor 20mg daily, Sertraline 100mg daily, LT4 100 mcg qd-increased recently due to elevated TSH, Tricor 145mg daily, Amitriptyline 50mg qhs, Calcitriol 0.25mcg daily, Warfarin, Lantus 90units 


Review of Systems: 

ALL OTHER SYSTEMS AND SUBSYSTEMS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND ARE NEGATIVE. 


Physical exam:  In general, very pleasant male, obese, appears to be no acute distress. Weight: 246.6 pounds. Vital sign: BP: 97/54 mmHg, HR 83, irregular by nursing assistant; 90/60 mmHg (sitting)  80/60 (standing), HR 90 (sitting)  66 (standing), irregular by me. HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, conjunctivae noninjected; oral mucosa without lesions, dry. NECK: supple, no lymphadenopathy; no thyromegaly. CV: Irreg Irreg, normal S1 and S2, no murmur; no rub, or gallop. Lung: good air entry and no crackles. JVP: ~9 cm. ABDOMEN: obese, normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender;  no bruises. EXTREMITIES: no pitting lower extremity edema. SKIN:  no petechia. NEURO:  awake, alert, and oriented, no asterixis, muscle strength: 5/5, symmetrical.  


Assessment: 76 year old male with history of stage III CKD most likely due to DM, microvascular disease and PAF who presents with fatigue, decreased appetite, and occasional nausea/vomiting in the last month, as well as low bp and worsening renal function. I believe his low bp and hypothyroidism are likely contributing to his fatigue. His Cr has increased from 1.74 to 2.1, which I suspect is prerenal from decreased perfusion due to low blood pressure and mild dehydration, exacerbated by CHF and PAF. Nausea/vomiting and decreased appetite likely due to gastroparesis from long-standing DM. 


Plan: 

  Decrease Metoprolol XL to 50mg in am, 25mg in pm, with plan to titrate down to 25mg am/25mg pm if SBP < 100 on daily BP checks Will check labs today, including BMP, CBC, Ca, Mg, Phos, urine protein/Cr, TSH, 25-OH vit D, and iPTH. Continue Ergocalciferol for 12 weeks and Calcitriol 0.25 mcg daily for Vit D deficiency.   Hypothyroidism: On Synthroid 100 mcg po qd.  Tachycardia: Irregularly irregular. Managed by Dr. Lilly.   Encourage exercise as fatigue improves. Mr. Jones will return to Renal Clinic for follow up in 6 weeks.

Dear Dr. Manu: 



I am writing you to update you on your patient, Blaine Johnson. As you know, the patient is a delightful 58-year-old gentleman with a history with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 35%, alcohol abuse, hypertension and diabetes who presented with a CRT-D pocket erosion in early January and underwent uncomplicated transvenous lead extraction of all hardware, with cutting and retraction of the epicardial leads on January 6, 2014. He completed his course of antibiotic therapy. Today, he was taken to the electrophysiology laboratory at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and underwent successful implantation of right pectoral St. Jude CRTD. The patient made an uneventful recovery.I expect an overnight stay. I will arrange for appropriate followup. 



Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this interesting and delightful patient. Please do not hesitate to call me with any further questions. 


Sincerely, 

Melanie Maytin, MD

REASON FOR VISIT:  Suture removal.   


Blaine is a 58-year-old male, who is here for suture removal and followup after having an automatic implantable cardioverted defibrillator removed, and then treated for subsequent infection by infectious disease a few weeks ago.  Dr. Sampson saw Blaine last week.  At this time, his wound was noted to be healing quite well, but the sutures would have to stay in place for another week.  His drain was removed last week.  He is now about 20 days out from surgery.  The patient has a multitude of medical conditions which are being treated.  He lives in northern Maine, very close to the border of Canada, and will be returning home on Saturday.  He does not think his incision is closing well. He denies fevers, chills and pain. 


On exam, there is a partially nonhealing incision line on the left upper chest, at the previous site of his AICD, which is no longer in place.  The middle portion of the incision is not closed, and the wound edges are not touching.  There is a gap that you can see where the nylon sutures are in place.   


Left chest. Picture taken on 2/6/14 in plastic surgery clinic. 


There is no evidence of infection and there is scant serous drainage when palpating the surrounding area.  Sutures were removed today and the wound was dressed with hydrogel and a dry sterile dressing. 


Blaine is a 58-year-old male, who has a history of nonischemic myopathy, CHF, diabetes mellitus type 2, and alcohol abuse, who recently had an infected wound on his left chest after AICD removal.  He is taking his last dose of Rocephin today.  His entire antibiotic course was managed by the infectious disease team.  I ended up removing the sutures today, because leaving them in another week or two would not have changed the way this wound was healing.  The size of the gap between the 2 wound edges was about 0.5 cm.  In length, the opening is about 4 cm.  Unfortunately, this wound healing has stalled, but will hopefully begin to granulate and fill in with hydrogel dressing changes.  The patient is returning home to northern Maine on Saturday, and has been advised to follow up with his primary care physician for weekly wound checks.  If the wound does not begin to granulate in, it is possible that he will need a procedure to freshen the wound edges and reclose the incision.  He knows to contact the infectious disease department if any signs of infection return.  I will let Dr. Sampson know what decisions were made today regarding this patient.  The patient knows he can call with any questions or concerns, and he can always send pictures, via the Internet, of his wound.   


A total of 20 minutes was spent with this patient today.

To Whom it May Concern: 


Mr. Blaine Johnson (01/18/1956) was seen in Brigham and Women's Hospital Infectious Disease Clinic today on 2/4/14.  He is doing quite well.  His wound is healing nicely, he has not had fevers or chills, he is tolerating antibiotics well and no problems with the PICC line.  I would recommend the following plan: 


1.  Continue IV daptomycin and IV ceftriaxone through 2/6/14 to complete a 4 week course since the removal of the prior device. 

2.  After his dose on 2/6/14 then D/C daptomycin, D/C ceftriaxone and D/C PICC line. 

3.  No further antibiotics planned after 2/6/14, please monitor off antibiotics - contact me if any fevers, wound drainage, or other signs/symptoms of recurrent infection. 

4.  Mr. Johnson's Cardiology team (Dr. Melanie Maytin at BWH Cardiology) will be arranging a date and time for implantation of new cardiac device which will likely be sometime in the next 4 weeks. 

5.  Mr. Johnson should continue follow-up with his Plastic Surgery team -- per Dr. Sampson's note from 1/29/14 he would like to see the patient back in clinic this week (one week since last appointment) for re-evaluation and hopefully suture removal.  Please contact Dr. Sampson's clinic (BWH Plastic Surgery) to arrange this appointment if not already arranged. 


Please contact me if there are any questions or concerns about this plan - I can be reached at the BWH ID Clinic (617-732-8881), through the BWH pager operator (617-732-6660 pgr 36988), or my cell phone (415-425-5315).

Mr. Johnson is here for followup of his infected AICD removal.  His wound is healing quite well.  The drain output is minimal, and today, the JP is removed.  He has only 13 days out from surgery, so we will leave the sutures in for another week.  Wound care instructions were given, and he will follow up in 1 week's time.

Dear Dr. Manu: 


I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, William Johnson, in device clinic at Brigham and Women's Hospital in followup to his recent CRT-D extraction performed 01/06/14.   


I know you are familiar with his history, but I will summarize it for our record keeping.  Mr. Johnson is a delightful 58-year-old gentleman with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 35%, alcohol abuse, hypertension and diabetes who presented with a CRT-D pocket erosion in early January.  Initial CRT-D implant was performed in 2002 with subsequent generator change 2005.  In 2006, he had epicardial leads placed, and on 11/15/13, he underwent generator replacement with pocket revision and capping of a fractured epicardial lead.  There was a note of fluctuance in the pocket on December 30, although the device had the appearance of chronic erosion on presentation in January.  On 01/06/14, he underwent uncomplicated transvenous lead extraction of all hardware, with cutting and retraction of the epicardial leads.  He remains in rehab with an external defibrillator vest in place and on intravenous antibiotics therapy with cefepime and daptomycin.  The incision was left open and closed by plastic surgery with subsequent revision of the closure.  He reports feeling well without fevers, chills or sweats, pain or tenderness of the site. 


Blood pressure 121/55, pulse 70.  He appears well in no acute distress.  The incision appears to be healing well with good approximation of the wound margins with the exception of a small region in the mid portion of the incision.  There is a GP drain in place still.  There is a separate note with pictures documenting the appearance of the incision. 


He had an EKG obtained today demonstrates sinus rhythm at 69 with left bundle-branch block.  QRS duration 170 milliseconds. 


In summary, Mr. Johnson is a 58-year-old gentleman with a local CRT-D infection who underwent extraction 01/06/14, requiring a secondary closure by plastic surgery and remaining on long-term IV antibiotics.  Timing of the reimplant will depend upon the duration of antibiotic therapy.  He has an appointment scheduled with Dr. Robbins, of Infectious Disease on Friday. In general, we manage local infections with 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy. We can proceed with a right pectoral CRT-D implant once antibiotic course is completed and left pectoral incision is closed.  I believe a trial of endovascular LV lead placement is reasonable and if successful, then we could examine surgical options.  I believe we are likely aiming for the last week of February, the first week of March, but I will confirm these dates with Drs. Robbins and Sampson.   


More than 50% of this 30-minute visit was spent discussing the planned management strategy for device reimplantation and LV lead placement. 


Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient.  Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.   


Sincerely,

Mr. Johnson is here for followup of his left chest wound following removal of an infected AICD.  The wound is clean and healing well.  I think we can now proceed with direct washout and wound closure.  We will schedule this for later this week and in the meantime, continue with wet-to-dry dressings.  All of his questions were answered.

Dear Dr. Devarajan: 


I had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Mr. Blaine Johnson, while he was here on the Cardiology Service at the Brigham and Women's Hospital.  Allow me to summarize his hospital course here on the Cardiology Service for your records. 


As you know, Mr. Johnson is a 57-year-old gentleman with a history of a nonischemic cardiomyopathy who had an ICD generator change on November 15, 2013.  He unfortunately developed a device infection and presented in early January with a progressive pocket erosion and a fever.  Blood cultures were drawn and he was transferred to the Brigham and Women's Hospital for device explantation.  He was taken to the operating room on January 6, 2014 by Dr. Maytin for removal of his CRT-D.  He had epicardial pacing wires that were left in at the time of the operation, but the pacemaker and associated infected tissue was excised.  He was seen in consultation by Dr. Robbins of the Infectious Disease Service as well as Dr. Megan Baker.  At the time of his discharge, they recommended continuation of intravenous antibiotics for a 3 weeks minimum.  Their suggestion was daptomycin and ceftriaxone while at the Rehabilitation Hospital with weekly laboratories to ensure safety.  Those laboratories are a CBC with differential, a basic metabolic panel, liver function tests and a CK.  Future Infectious Disease input can be obtained from paging Dr. Robbins through the Brigham page operator, his pager number is 31041 and a page operator number is 617-732-6660. 


He was also seen by Plastic Surgery.  Because of the extent of the wound, Plastic Surgery recommended wet-to-dry dressing to continue for the time being.  He will see Dr. Christian Sampson of Plastic Surgery here at the Brigham on January 13th at 12:45 p.m.  At that point, Dr. Sampson will decide whether or not to use a VAC dressing for his wound.  In the future, Plastic Surgery plans to close the wound rather than having it heal by secondary intention. 


He will see Dr. Melanie Maytin of the Electrophysiology section on January 28th at 3 p.m.  Given his history of cardiomyopathy and ventricular arrhythmias, he is being discharged with a LifeVest, which is a defibrillator that he can wear.  He should use this until the point in the future when he has a device reinstalled.  I would like to note both on behalf of the Infectious Disease specialist and electrophysiologist that he continues to have epicardial leads that are in his chest.  We do not think that those are infected at this time, but should he have fevers and other symptoms of systemic infection, it certainly is a possibility that should be considered. 


Thus, at the time of discharge, his medications to a rehabilitation facility include daptomycin 6 mg/kg every 48 hours, ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously every day.  He is on aspirin 81 mg daily, folic acid 1 mg daily, Cyanocobalamin 250 mcg daily, multivitamin, thiamine, lisinopril 10 mg daily, insulin sliding scale, metoprolol succinate extended release 50 mg daily, Ropinirole 0.5 mg at bedtime, citalopram 20 mg daily, a nicotine patch, gabapentin 300 mg 3 times a day, oxycodone 5-10 mg as needed for pain and Tylenol as needed for pain. 


Finally, prior to the implantation of a new defibrillator or pacing device, he should see a dentist because his dentition makes him at risk for seating of any future device that might be implanted. 


Thank you for the opportunity to care for your patient and please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any further questions about his hospital course. 


Sincerely,

Infectious Disease Diagnosis:  


ICD pocket infection, s/p removal of device, with retention of epicardial leads, and wound likely requiring complex plastics closure 


57 yo M w nICMP s/p ICD generator change 11/15/13 with early device infection (exposed device with purulence), and no systemic symptoms, with negative blood cultures off of antibiotics.  Superficial wound swab outside grew only CoNS, as has repeat wound swab here.  He was taken for device explantation 1/6/14, which included removal of device, debridement of pocket, and removal of intravascular leads.  He had two epicardial leads placed in 2006 that were cut at the level of the chest wall and pulled up through the pocket site.  The second incision was surgically unremarkable, as were the leads at that level, with no cultures sent from that site.  Cultures from the OR remain sterile, after antibiotics.  He is planning for return for plastics evaluation and likely admission for complex closure. 


He will require weekly labs, as outlined below. 


He is planning to return for admission and closure at that point. 


He requires a minimum course of 3 week of the IV antibiotic regimen outlined below, pending further operative plans.   


Please re-involve inpatient infectious disease at time of readmission to help with ID plan, pending on operative plans. 


If for any reason this plan is changed, he will require ID follow up, whcih can either be arranged through the BWH ID clinic or through an ID physician local to him. 


Additionally, if planning to reimplant an ICD (or otherwise), he would likely benefit from a dental consult.

01/05/2014 

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Devarajun Manu, Maine Medical Center via Usha Tedrow, MD at BWH Cardiovascular Medicine, Section of Electrophysiology 


Problem List:  

1.  Former woodsman, who stopped working due to cardiac disability, in addition to significant ethanol abuse. 

2.  Trim stature. 

3.  Type 2 diabetes treated with sitagliptin.   

4.  Dyslipidemia, treated with simvastatin. 

5.  Hypertension, treated with metoprolol and lisinopril.  01/04/14 BUN 16, creatinine 1.13, potassium 4.2, magnesium 1.5, hematocrit 36.6, platelets 179. 

6.  Inveterate smoker.  Ethanol abuse.  11/2013 alcohol withdrawal.  States that he has had only 1 day of drinking since 11/2013, and with abstention, is sleeping better and feeling better. 

7.  Electrical.  IVCD with infection. 

A.  2002, for ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction below 20%, received ICD. 

B.  2006 may have received epicardial leads, with generator change.  12/2012 reported 14 seconds of VF, spontaneously terminated, without device discharge, but strips not necessarily available for documentation, and accuracy not entirely known. 

C.  11/2013, for end of life, received St. Jude Medical CRTD.  Apparently 1 of the epicardial leads had fractured and was capped, but there was another epicardial lead present that was utilized. 

D.  Early 01/2014, progressive pocket erosion, with fever, and transferred to BWH for device explant. 

8.  Nonischemic cardiomyopathy, with reported small membranous VSD.  2002, with ejection fraction 16%, underwent cardiac catheterization that by report disclosed no coronary artery irregularities.  Discussion of small VSD. 

9.  Last cardiac noninvasive structural/functional studies. 

A.  2002 ejection fraction in 20% range with global hypokinesis. 

B.  12/2013 ejection fraction reported as 20% to 40%, with mild left atrial dilatation and mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and accuracy of membranous VSD not certain. 


Blaine Johnson is a 57-year-old man transferred from Maine Medical Center for device explantation.  Detailed above is his history of inveterate smoking, ethanol abuse with an episode of withdrawal in 11/13, though he states he has not had any alcohol for more than 1 month; diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and an ejection fraction in the 20% to 40% range.  By report, the device, implanted in 2002 and revised in 2006, with epicardial leads, and with a generator change in 11/2013, is perhaps documented in an episode of 2012 ventricular fibrillation that was only 14 seconds and that did not require device discharge. 


Mr. Johnson states that he has generally been feeling fine.  He can walk on level ground without dyspnea, and he sleeps on 1 pillow.  He has not had chest discomfort.  When he walks quickly or moves in the woods, he develops dyspnea.  He has not had lower extremity swelling.  He has not had malaise or fever of which he is aware, or chills.   


The home regimen includes aspirin 81 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, metoprolol perhaps titrate 50 mg twice daily, simvastatin 40 mg daily, sitagliptin, and perhaps magnesium. 


The transfer regimen includes lisinopril that has been reduced to 2.5 mg daily, metoprolol tartrate 50 mg twice daily, simvastatin 40 mg daily, a nicotine patch, and aspirin 81 mg daily, vancomycin and cefepime. 


On examination, the blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg with a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12.  He is comfortable lying flat.  The neck veins are not elevated.  The carotid upstrokes are brisk and the volumes are surprisingly good.  There are no carotid bruits.  The lungs are clear.  The infected device is bandaged, but there is known skin erosion.  There is no right ventricular lift.  The PMI is displaced laterally.  There is a mildly distant S1 and a paradoxically split S2.  I do not hear any definite mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, and I do not hear a suggestion of a high membranous VSD.  The abdomen is benign.  The distal pulses are normal.  There is no peripheral edema.  The electrocardiogram is not available. 


IMPRESSION:  Mr. Johnson has an infected ICD, apparently with an epicardial lead as well as endocardial leads.  He will remain on antibiotics and very shortly undergo an extraction, I would suspect, of all of the leads - there may be 2 epicardial leads based on discussion, and I have not seen a chest x-ray.  He will be observed for a few days, and depending on his course, decision can be made regarding the timing of re-implantation.  Perhaps everything could be done from an endocardial standpoint.  He claims that he has not had any alcohol for more than 4 weeks, but he will receive thiamine and benzodiazepines as necessary.

ID Attending note:   

We were asked by Dr. Adler to aid with assessment and treatment of an ICD infection.  


Case discussed in detail with Dr. Robbins. Please see Dr. Robbins note for details. I would like to emphasize and add the following: 57 yo man with cardiomyopathy who was transferred for device extraction due to ICD site wound dehiscence. He had a BiV device placed in 2002 for a diagnosis of alcoholic cardiomyopthy. The battery was replaced in 2005 and upgraded in 2006 with epicardial lead placement. On 11/15/13 he underwent a BiV ICD battery change, pocket revision and capping of a fractured LV epicardial lead. In 12/13 he noted serosanguinous drainage from the ICD site, denies fevers and chills. On 12/30/13 he was seen by his PCP and a scab with fluctuance and purulent discharge was noted. Blood cx were drawn 12/30, 12/31. A wound swab grew CoNS. He was hospitalized on 1/2/14 and was started on cefepime and vanco. After vanco infusion he was reported to drop pressure and become SOB. Vanco was d/cd. A TTE was performed and there was concern for a slight abnormality of the aortic valve.  


I performed a history and exam of this patient, and confirmed the medical decision making and plan of care with Dr. Robbins. A review of systems was performed, with pertinent positive and negative findings noted above; all other systems were negative in detail.Tm 96.5 P 90 BP 108/70  RR 18 93% RA  

Gen in bed, NAD, HEENT NC/AT, poor dentition, no conjunctival hemorrhages, chest clear bilaterally, CV RRR distant heart sounds, no M, Abd + BS NT/ND, soft,  Ext: no edema no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis. 


I reviewed Dr. Robbins note and agree with the documented findings for history, exam, test results, and recommendations for care. 57 yo man with cardiomyopathy who was transferred for device extraction due to ICD site wound dehiscence. The most recent manipulation of the device was in 11/13. It appears that the dehiscence has progressed slowly. Blood cx from 12/30 and 12/31 with NGTD on no abx according to the patient and records. Agree with plan for ICD extraction and TEE to evaluate the valves. Would favor continuing treatment with cefepime and intiating daptomycin. Agree with conservative management and would hold on re-implantation on the R side for at least 72 hours, provided that blood cx are negative and that the TEE shows no sign of vegetations. 

Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.

ATTENDING: 


CC: AICD pocket dehiscence 


HPI:  

Mr. Johnson is a 57 yo M with a history of non-ischemic CMP EF 35%, alcohol abuse last drink 2 Jan 2014, HTN, DM2 who presents with ICD pocket wound dehiscence and concern for infection.  


Mr. Johnson had a Medtronic BiV ICD inserted in 2002 after he was diagnosed with non ischemic CMP w/ reduced EF. In 2005 he had a battery change without incidence. In 2006 he had epicardial leads placed. On 11/15/2013 he underwent BiV ICD battery replacement and pocket revision. He also had capping of a fractured epicardial lead at this time. His initial postoperative course was complicated by severe etoh withdrawal and delirium tremens as well as AKI.  Several days after the procedure he noticed a serosanguinous drainage from the the pocket site. This drainage persisted for weeks until it transitioned to a thicker yellow-brown purulent material. He was then seen by his PCP on 12/30 he noticed some fluctuance to the pocket. He was then seen by his cardiologist who drew blood cultures and did an echocardiogram.  His initial blood cultures were no growth.  He was sent to OSH in Bangor to be hospitalized and given antibiotics. 


At OSH, he was pan-cultured, and started on cefepime and vancomycin. He was also started on CIWA scale. On 1/3/13 the patient became acutely hypotensive to 60s/40s with throat burning/closing sensation 5 minutes after receiving IV vancomycin.  His sudden deterioration was initially thought to be DTs and was given benzos. He was sent to the ICU and required BiPAP and levophed. His mental status improved with cessation of benzodiazepines. This morning, he reported concern that the vancomycin had caused his reaction, and his vancomycin was stopped. He also had a TTE done with no signs of valvular or wire vegetations.  He is transferred to the BWH for AICD extraction. Per  OSH report his device was interrogated the patient is not pacer dependent. He denies any history of arrhythmia and the device appears to have been placed originally for primary prevention.  


Mr. Johnson denies any fevers/chills. No rashes or night sweats. No abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, n/v. No dysuria or retention. No CP, SOB, LE edema. No weakness, numbness, tingling, joint pain, or changes in mood. His last drink was 12/31

Patient will require complete device extraction followed by course of antibiotics.  Will likely require LifeVest for bridge given hx of VF on device interrogation.  Not dependent on pacing so would not re-implant at time of extraction.  No s/s of systemic infection, however, will plan to have TEE performed by cardiac anesthesiologist to obtain closer look at AV at time of extraction.  Plan for extraction tomorrow PM.
Reviewed risk/benefit/alternatives with patient and anserwed all questions.  Risk reviewed included but not limited to death, vascular damage, infection, PTX, CVA, MI, damage to cardiac valve, cardiac perforation 

-NPO Past midnight 

-no further heparin/lovenox for DVT proph after this PM
-I have contacted OR desk and placed patient as add on extraction for tomorrow PM
-will send additional cultures at time of procedure

HPI:   


57yo M who is transferred for device extraction due to ICD site wound dehiscence, without systemic symptoms.  He has a believed alcoholic cardiomyopathy for which a BiV device was placed 2002, battery replaced 2005, and upgraded in 2006 with epicardial lead placement via thoracotomy, most recently s/p 11/15/13 BiV ICD battery change, pocket revision, and capping of fractured LV epicardial lead and use of previously capped left ventricular epicardial lead.  That hospitalization was complicated by delirium tremens, and AKI to a peak of 2.1.  He missed a follow up EP appointment.  A couple weeks after placement he started to have serosanguinous drainage from the lateral aspect of the scar.  This progressed over the next couple weeks to include  and saw his PCP 12/30/13 where a scab with fluctuance was found, as well as purulent drainage.  He had taken no antibiotics prior to presentation.  He had blood cultures drawn on 12/30 and 12/31, all NG/NGTD.  A superficial wound swab culture has grown scant CoNS.  He has had no systemic symptoms prior to admission.   By transfer records appears to have been admitted to Houlton around 1/2 and transferred to Eastern Maine Medical , where he was started on cefepime and vancomycin.  After infusion of vancomycin he had what appeared to be an anaphylactic response on 1/3, requiring pressors and ICU transfer, with hypoxia.  When he woke up he felt fine.  Blood cultures were drawn at this time, and are NGTD.  His hardware is exposed in te pocket, with device and leads visible, with some purulent drainage.  He has no complaints.  A TTE was performed, with cardiology questioning possibly slight abnormality of aortic valve. A TEE is planned.  We are asked for recommendations for antibotics, and timing of reimplantation.   

His device is placed for primary prevention; he has not been shocked, but has had episodes of vetricular fibrillation resolving spontaneously (apparently 14 seconds documented in 2012)

57 yo M w nICMP s/p ICD generator change 11/15/13 with early device infection (exposed device with purulence), and no systemic symptoms, with negative blood cultures off of antibiotics.  Superficial wound swab outside grew only CoNS.  He is clinically well.  His device has both intravascular and extravascular (epicardial leads).  Given device infection, agree with EP plan to remove device and all leads.  He has negative blood cultures off of antibiotics, and no clinical evidence of endocarditis; however given slight aortic abnormality noted on discussion with EP, agree with plan for TEE to better evaluate aortic valve.  He appears anaphylactic to vancomycin; can cover gram positive--resistant staph including MRSA and many CoNS inherently resistant to cephalosporins, with daptomycin.  Reimplantation after negative TEE, debridement of pocket and removal of all leads is acceptably by IDSA guidelines anytime beyond 72 hours from 1/3/13 blood cultures, provided they remain negative.  However, seems very reasonable to delay reimplantation further, and appears to be tentative plan on discussion with EP.   


Recommendations: 


-given infected device, favor complete device and lead removal, with pocket tissue, and device sent for microbiology 

-agree with plan for TEE to rule out vegetations 

-please swab pocket now for microbiology 

-follow up outside blood cultures 

-by IDSA guidelines would be acceptable to implant new device following removal of current infected device, and adequate debridement of generator pocket after 72 hours from 1/3/13 blood cultures, provided TEE is negative 

-continue cefepime 2grams IV q12 

-continue daptomycin 6mg/kg q24; please check CK for baseline 



Case discussed and recommendations reviewed with Dr. Baker 

Thank you for this consultation.  We will continue to follow with you.  


Recommendations conveyed directly to primary team.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

57 year old man with alcohol dependence, history of niCMP (EF 20%), s/p CRTD with lead failure s/p epicardial lead placement, now with wound dehiscence after generator replacement 11/13, transferred from OSH 


# Wound dehiscence: now with wound dehiscence of AICD pocket site after generator replacement  in November. Evidence of infection with brown malodorous drainage, erythema and fluctuance though no SIRs criteria.   

- EP consult in AM for extraction 

- Will hold on vancomycin given allergy and no hemodynamic instability. Will continue the cefepime for now (if becomes sick, add back MRSA coverage). 

- Blood Cx x 2 

- CXR PALateral 

- Telemetry 

- Consider ID consult given extent of erosion in the context of hardware and choice/duration of antibiotics.  

- Echo images not sent with patient. Consider repeat TTE to ensure no valvular vegetations.  


# CV-P: History of niCMP (ef 20%), likely 2/2 alcohol use vs idiopathic. Most recent TTE with EF 35%. Currently appears euvolemic 

- Cont lisinopril 2.5mg 

- Cont BB 

- Strict I/Os 

- Daily weights 

- 2gm Na diet 


# Alcohol dependence: history of heavy alcohol use/dependence, although no recent use per patient x3 weeks. Possible DTs at OSH (although patient became altered, hypotensive in setting of vancomycin administration), likely to be out of withdrawal period at this point.  

- ACE SW consult 

- CIWA 

- Thiamine, folate, MVI 


# HTN: BPs reportedly soft at OSH (actual BPs at OSH not known)

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 Follow up for cardiomyopathy and nedd for ? CRT-D

 Interval History:
 Greg's note: This is a 49 yo male with h/o HTN, who was admitted to MGH for dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, and cellulitis in late December 2013 and was found to have biventricular heart failure by echocardiogram. He was started on neurohormonal blockade - ACE-I, beta blocker and spironolactone. He was aggressively diuresed and discharged with a LifeVest. Initially, he was struggling with GI symptoms and lack of appetite. At his last visit, he had significant improvement in his appetite and activity tolerance. We have been able to incrementally increase his ACE-I and beta blocker. 

He resumed his diuretics when his weight increased to 246lbs and he had associated symptoms of bloating in his abdomen and orthopnea. He is now using a sliding scale to keep his weight in the 240-243lb range. The abdominal bloating has resolved. He has residual lower extremity edema, right greater than left. Last week, he was evaluated at the South Shore Hospital for increased swelling and warmth of his right leg. His visiting nurse was suspicious of cellulitis. He underwent an ultrasound which ruled out lower extremity DVT and x-rays which had no evidence of fractures. He was given a dose of IV antibiotics and started on clindamycin 300mg TID for 5 days. His last dose was yesterday. He noted a significant improvement in the redness and warmth and modest improvement in the swelling. His foot pain was initially improved but recurred 2 days ago. 

He has continued to walk almost daily for 30-60 minutes at the mall. He feels that his gait is more steady. He has no shortness of breath and has to rest because of fatigue. He has increased endurance over the past month. He is also performing his exercise routine given to him by his physical therapist. He denies dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, syncope, pre-syncope or chest discomfort. He has daytime fatigue at times because of false alarms of his LifeVest which interrupt his sleep. He denies PND or orthopnea.

Assessment and Plan: 

Cardiomyopathy. - He appears euvolemic with improved blood pressure, appetite and activity tolerance. We will continue with maximizing his neurohormonal blockade by increasing his lisinopril to 10mg BID. He will have labs drawn in 7-10days to make sure that he has stable potassium and kidney function. 
-We encouraged continued aerobic activity with adequate pacing to avoid undue fatigue. 
-He will continue with the same sliding scale for his Bumex, taking it only when needed for fluid retention. 
-Repeat echocardiogram at 3 month after initiation of appropriate HF pharmacotherapy (Mar 28th), to determine if he meets criteria for ICD/CRT-D. He has an IVCD with QRS=134, although borderline I think CRT is worth strongly considering if he has persistent LVSD.

Hypertension. - History of hypertension in the past. We will continue to monitor. He is currently on telemonitoring with borderline diastolic readings.

Habits/Risk Screening: 
Activity level: sedentary walking short distances. Working with home PT
Smoking status: former smoker former chewing tobacco

RE: Follow up for cardiomyopathy and nedd for ? CRT-D

Dear Greg:

 I had the pleasure of seeing Steven in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service clinic today on his 50th birthday. As you may recall he has a h/o HTN, who was admitted to MGH for dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, and cellulitis in late December 2013 and was found to have biventricular heart failure by echocardiogram. He was started on neurohormonal blockade - ACE-I, beta blocker and spironolactone. He was aggressively diuresed and discharged with a LifeVest. Initially, he was struggling with GI symptoms and lack of appetite. At his last visit, he had significant improvement in his appetite and activity tolerance. We have been able to incrementally increase his ACE-I and beta blocker. 

He has continued to walk almost daily for 30-60 minutes at the mall. He feels that his gait is more steady. He has no shortness of breath and has to rest because of fatigue. He has increased endurance over the past month. He is also performing his exercise routine given to him by his physical therapist. He denies dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, syncope, pre-syncope or chest discomfort. He has daytime fatigue at times because of false alarms of his LifeVest which interrupt his sleep. He denies PND or orthopnea. 
His repeat echo shows no improvement in his LVEF (17%) with a significantly remodeled LV. 

 Past medical history:
 HTN 
Depression 
Anxiety 
R knee surgery, football related trauma

 Family history 
 Adopted, does not know family history.

 Social history:
 Social ETOH, chewing tobacco, quit few months prior to admission. Divorced, has a girlfriend who is a nurse at MGH. One son

-HEENT: Unremarkable
-Chest: Clear but decreased. No crackles or wheezes.
-Cardiac: RRR, Normal S1and S2, No S3 or S4. No murmurs or gallops
-Abdomen: Soft. non-tender. No hepatomegaly. Normal bowel sounds
-Extremities: No edema. Color changes of venous stasis. 2+ pulses bilaterally.

 Assessment and plan:
 Mr. Frank is a 59 year old gentleman with a h/o HTN, who was admitted to MGH for dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, subsequently diagnosed with biventricular failure in 12/2013. He underwent tailored therapy and was discharged on neurohormonal blockers and with a Lifevest for prevention of SCD. He has had a significant improvement in activity tolerance. His QRS width is 138 (v1)-152 ms (in V5). He describes NYHA Class II-III symptoms. For his young age, it is more like Class III NYHA. His LV has adversely remodeled and his LVEF is 17%. Clearly moving in the wrong direction and would benefit from an ICD with CRT therapy. He is on coumadin for a LV thrombus. He will stay on the coumadin with an INR in the range of 2.0 to 2.5.
I have spoken to him at length about this and he is willing to proceed. He has a date scheduled for April 17th for the procedure.

 Reason for visit:
 Follow up for cardiomyopathy and hypertension

 Interval History:
 This is a 49 yo male with h/o HTN, who was admitted to MGH for dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, and cellulitis in late December 2013 and was found to have biventricular heart failure by echocardiogram. He was started on neurohormonal blockade - ACE-I, beta blocker and spironolactone. He was aggressively diuresed and discharged with a LifeVest. Initially, he was struggling with GI symptoms and lack of appetite. At his last visit, he had significant improvement in his appetite and activity tolerance. We have been able to incrementally increase his ACE-I and beta blocker. 

He resumed his diuretics when his weight increased to 246lbs and he had associated symptoms of bloating in his abdomen and orthopnea. He is now using a sliding scale to keep his weight in the 240-243lb range. The abdominal bloating has resolved. He has residual lower extremity edema, right greater than left. Last week, he was evaluated at the South Shore Hospital for increased swelling and warmth of his right leg. His visiting nurse was suspicious of cellulitis. He underwent an ultrasound which ruled out lower extremity DVT and x-rays which had no evidence of fractures. He was given a dose of IV antibiotics and started on clindamycin 300mg TID for 5 days. His last dose was yesterday. He noted a significant improvement in the redness and warmth and modest improvement in the swelling. His foot pain was initially improved but recurred 2 days ago. 

He has continued to walk almost daily for 30-60 minutes at the mall. He feels that his gait is more steady. He has no shortness of breath and has to rest because of fatigue. He has increased endurance over the past month. He is also performing his exercise routine given to him by his physical therapist. He denies dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, syncope, pre-syncope or chest discomfort. He has daytime fatigue at times because of false alarms of his LifeVest which interrupt his sleep.

Assessment and Plan: 
Mr. Frank is a 49 year old gentleman with a h/o HTN, who was admitted to MGH for dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, subsequently diagnosed with biventricular failure in 12/2013. He underwent tailored therapy and was discharged on neurohormonal blockers and with a Lifevest for prevention of SCD. He has had a significant improvement in activity tolerance. He describes NYHA Class II symptoms.

Cardiomyopathy . - He appears euvolemic with improved blood pressure, appetite and activity tolerance. We will continue with maximizing his neurohormonal blockade by increasing his lisinopril to 10mg BID. He will have labs drawn in 7-10days to make sure that he has stable potassium and kidney function. 
-We encouraged continued aerobic activity with adequate pacing to avoid undue fatigue. 
-He will continue with the same sliding scale for his Bumex, taking it only when needed for fluid retention. 
-Repeat echocardiogram at 3 month after initiation of appropriate HF pharmacotherapy (Mar 28th), to determine if he meets criteria for ICD/CRT-D. He has an IVCD with QRS=134, although borderline I think CRT is worth strongly considering if he has persistent LVSD.

Hypertension . - History of hypertension in the past. We will continue to monitor. He is currently on telemonitoring with borderline diastolic readings.

Cellulitis . - Right leg swelling and right foot pain suspicious for cellulitis. We suspect that the recurrent pain may be consistent with treatment failure and have prescribed Augmentin, which has been effective in the past and which he tolerated well. Augmentin for 7 day course. Recent US negative for DVT. If he does not improve on augmentin I would like him to see a vascular medicine specialist regarding his chronic venous stasis, assymetric edema.

HPI 

23 W with  history of congenital cardiac disease with truncus arteriosus, VSD and double chamber RV s/p truncal valve repair and an RV to PA conduit, ventricular muscle bundle resection and VSD closure in 1989 and redo truncal valve repair and tricuspid valve repair in 2002 followed by repeat truncal valve repair and tricuspid valve repair in 2005 as well as replacement of her RV to PA conduit with a 33-mm Hancock bioprosthesis, biventricular dysfunction (LVEF 21%), chronic intermittent chest pain, and anxiety who presents with sharp CP and was found to have intermittent high grade AV block.  


She presented after increased episodes of chest pain and palpitation. She describes "sharp"/"heavy" chest pain that is associated with a sensation of palpitations that typically lasts 1-2 minutes. After a recent episode EMS was called and at OSH she was noted to have episodes of bradycardia, 2:1 AVB, and occasional nonconduced p-waves (up to 2 in a row) consistent with high grade AV block. 


Of note, due to progressive LV dysfunction and widening QRS she was being planed for elective CRT-D implant at CHOP for resynchronization and primary prevention of sudden death. Due to the new evidence of heart block, EP was called to accelerate this plan for device implant. 


At baseline she reports progressive exertional fatigue and dyspnea, now occuring after walking several blocks (or up 1 flight of stairs). 


On tele she has been having frequent PACs with AV block and associated pauses, possible Mobitz type I AVB, and rare episodes of higher grade AV block with 2 consecutive nonconducted P waves. These episodes have been apparently asymptomatic.

is mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. The visually estimated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 21%. There is global hypokinesis. The left 
ventricular diastolic function appears abnormal, as indicated by the mitral 
inflow and tissue Doppler signals. There is evidence of restrictive filling 
with spectral and/or tissue Doppler, consistent with diastolic dysfunction.

There is moderate generalized RV systolic dysfunction.

CXR:  

     FINDINGS: The heart is markedly enlarged. Prior median sternotomy
     and surgical clips are seen. A round metallic density projects
     over the left aspect of the heart. There is diffuse interstitial
     edema with lower lung predominant alveolar edema also seen. No
     pneumothorax is seen. The pulmonary arteries are prominent.

     IMPRESSION: Interstitial and alveolar pulmonary edema. 

A/P:  

23 yo with TA s/p multiple surgical interventions (conduit replacements RV-PA as well as truncal valve) with mild (echo) to moderate (MRI) at most truncal valve regurgitation, with compensated severe LV failure (LVEF 21% on recent TTE). She now presents with concern for bradyarrhythmia. Most observed brady events appear to be related to nonconducted APCs, though she has had 2:1 AV block and a couple recorded episodes of two consecutive nonconducted atrial beats. Regardless, she has severe LV dysfunction with a very wide QRS (IVCD but left bundle-like morphology) with NYHA class II-III symptoms, which makes her a good candidate for both primary prevention ICD as well as resynchronization therapy (CRT-D).  

-will plan CRT-D implant tomorrow with Dr. John. Dr. Ed Walsh of Childrens Hospital was contacted and will likely be present. 

-please keep NPO p MD

Patient: Lena Antonio 

26965550 

BACH Outpatient MD: Landzberg 

EP at CH: Dominic Abrams 

Cardiology outpatient: Nathan Beraha 


Presentation: 


Lena is a 23-year-old woman with truncus arteriosus, VSD and double chamber RV.  (see below for Medical Problems and impression)  

s/p initial surgery in 1989 with truncal valve repair and an RV to PA conduit, ventricular muscle bundle resection and VSD closure, s/p redo truncal valve repair and tricuspid valve repair in 2002 followed by repeat truncal valve repair and tricuspid valve repair in 2005 as well as replacement of her RV to PA conduit with a 33-mm Hancock bioprosthesis.   

-lost from follow through 2010 (return to Nate Beraha, Providence) who noted poor ventricular systolic function and moderate truncal valve regurgitation.  Subsequent course with BACH has been one of return to life-long care, self-awareness of medical needs and long-term heart failure therapies, decreasing volume intake (which had been high due to work environment/heat in factory, as well as beginning carevdilol, ACEI and discussing and planning for CRT-ICD, based upon a natural history that is more dependent upon her decreased LV contractile function than her conoventricular defect (truncus arteriosus). 

-NB: IVCD at baseline, with strong LBBB like features to baseline CRBBB, PR 240 msec 

-NB: typical 1 flight DOE, otherwise all activities of daily living; daily nightmares but denies orthopnea and PND, no peripheral edema or ascites; she responds with increased urine output to diuretics (Lasix) 


This note reflects 50 minutes face to face in medical encounter, + 60 minutes orchestrating transfer, EP teams, care teams, with > 50% spent discussing findings,implications, and suggested plans. Reviewed past medical surgical social family histories, > 10 system ROS, examined Lena, reviewed data and synthesized and formulated plans. 


Presentation this past evening from work due to sensed tachycardia, increased SOB (one week or so of increased SOB and fatigue), CP (mid chest, ache and pain) sufficient for her employer to recognize her difficulties at work (pipe-fitter), calling EMS and transit to Rhode Island Hospital, where EKGs noted SBrady, with episodic 2:1 block, episodic higher order apparent near CHB, reverting at times to SBrady.   No history of recent tick exposure, no thyroid disease, no overdose of medication. 

-At RIH, SWBP 80-90, HR 40s, JVP not elevated, O2 sats 93-95, chest clear, cor without S3, normal electrolytes, elevated BNP, no elevation cTNi; transferred to BACH (no beds CH CCU, no BWH CCU, pending telemetry BWH)

Social History:  She lives on her own.  At most one beer/day.  She does not smoke cigarettes, uses no recreational drugs and practices safe sex. 


She has made a tremendous effort at increasing her exercise. She bowls but picking up the ball can make her quite short of breath. Works making submarines, was a manager at DAngelos; lots of time on computer daily

She is fiercely independent.  At her last visit, her mom accompanied her but she presents alone today having worked until midnight and then got up early to drive here and is quite fatigued. 

Review of systems: She frequently awakes with severe bilateral leg cramps that take a bit of time to resolve.  Otherwise interval review of systems is noncontributory. 

On examination, Lena is comfortable in the ER gurney.  HR 50s, SBP right 90s/60s. RR 10, weight pending recently 9/2013 142 pounds which is 64.4 kg up 2.3 kg from her last visit which was at the end of August.  Height 164 cm.  BMI was 23.8.  Pupils equal reactive, she is alert attentive warm perfused able to orient, engage. Neck supple. Carotid upstrokes brisk 2+.  Thyroid tissue could not be felt, not tender, no resting tremor.  Lungs clear bilaterally to percussion and auscultation with equal excursion without rales, rhonchi or wheezing.  Cardiac examination with dynamic precordium and a diffuse maximal impulse.  S1crisp.

Resting electrocardiogram revealed episodes of SB with APBs, at times high order 2-degree AVB suggesting CHB, but at times conduction, LBBB IVC QRS 190 msec 

Impression: 23 yo with TA s/p multiple surgical interventions (conduit replacements RV-PA as well as truncal valve) with mild (echo) to moderate (MRI) at most truncal valve regurgitation, with compensated LV failure on increasing medical support ramping up to CRT-ICD, now presenting with high degree block with signs at baseline of significant conduction disease with PR prolongation, as well as LBBB-type IVCD.  As well, sensed tachycardia and low EF in this population raising risk of VT and SCD, with plans as noted above.  We have arranged for transport to BWH, have discussed with past MDs and support team at CH, and we have asked assistance of BWH-EP team regarding 

            -guidance towards and timing of PM therapy, including potentials for CRT and ICD 


Until such, transcutaneous pacing at bedside, isuprel at bedside, telemetry

CC:  Chest pain 


HPI:  


23 W with a complicated history of congenital cardiac disease with truncus arteriosus, VSD and double chamber RV s/p truncal valve repair and an RV to PA conduit, ventricular muscle bundle resection and VSD closure in 1989 and redo truncal valve repair and tricuspid valve repair in 2002 followed by repeat truncal valve repair and tricuspid valve repair in 2005 as well as replacement of her RV to PA conduit with a 33-mm Hancock bioprosthesis, biventricular dysfunction (LVEF 21%), chronic intermittent chest pain, and anxiety who presents with sharp CP and was found to have a new Mobitz II block at OSH.  


The patient reports intermittent chest pain for several months. She describes "sharp"/"heavy" chest pain that is associated with a sensation of palpitations that typically lasts 1-2 minutes. These episodes are associated with anxiety, stress, and walking. Yesterday, she was at work when she developed her typical sharp substernal chest pain and palpitations, however, her pain lasted longer than normal (about 20 minutes), so EMS was called. Her chest pain resolved before she arrived to an OSH. At the OSH, she was intially noted to be bradycardic (40's) and hypotensive (80s), however these vitals normalized rapidly (HR 50-70s and SBP 90s to 150s) without intervention. An EKG showed new Mobitz II block without otherwise stable morphologies, BNP was elevated at 2300 and trop were negative. She received ASA 325 and morphine 2g before being transferred to BWH ED.  


In the BWH ED, initial vitals were 98.3, 60, 100/70, 18, 100 1-4 L NC. An EKG demonstrated Mobitz II block, baseline LBBB, but negative Sgarbossa's criteria for ischemia. Vitals were remained stable. The patient was chest pain free throughout her stay in the ED. Labs were sent which were notable for BNP 10486, CK 89, CK-MB 2.9, Trop T 0.02. CXR demonstrated interstitial and alveolar pulmonary edema. She received no treatment and was transferred to the floor with stable vitals.  


On the floor, the patient has no acute complaints. She endorses a decline in functional status over the last few months, with increased orthopnea and PND. She also has noticed increased fatigue (needing to go to bed earlier) and DOE over the past few weeks. She can climb one flight of stairs before stopping. She denies recent weight gain and says that she has been compliant with a low salt diet. She denies swelling in her legs. No lightheadedness or dizziness. No syncope. No recent cough. 


ROS: Denies fevers, chills, night sweats, weight change, decreased appetite, lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, hematuria, dysuria, lower extremity edema.

CV-r/Mobitz type II AV block: presented with new Mobitz type II block of unclear etiology. As below, chest pain seems unlikely to be due to ischemia. Other potential etiologies include baseline structural abnormalities. Patient has been intermittently bradycardic here but asymptomatic. 

Diagnostically 

- telemetry 

- Replete K, Mg prn (on scales) 

- Appreciate EP recs 

Therapeutically 

- transcutaneous pacing at bedside 

- isuprel prn for bradycardia 

- Plan for CRT/ICD tomorrow. 


CV/I - No history of CAD with chronic intermittent chest pain, previously thought not to be cardiac in etiology. Most recent episode also unlikely to represent ACS given spontaenous resolution, sharp nature, lack of EKG changes, association with emotional stress. However, the patient had mildly elevated enzymes in the BWH ED, so we will cycle cardiac enzymes to ROMI. Chest pain is more likely to be associated with anxiety, heart failure symptoms.  

- CBMs x3 q 8 hrs to ROMI.  

-O2 to maintain sats > 92% if hypoxia 

- Repeat EKGs prn for chest pain/SOB 

CV/P - Patient with compensated LV failure with recent EF 21% with declining functional status. Given worsening symptoms and EF, there were plans for CRT placement in the near future. Today, patient appears mildly volume up with elevated BNP, congestion on CXR, and JVP 8-9.  

- Daily I/Os, daily weights 

- Daily electrolytes, replete prn. On K/Mg scales 

- Appreciate EP recs 

- Plan for CRT placement tomorrow 

- Lasix 20 mg IV x1 and then will restart home PO lasix regimen.  

- Continue enalapril for afterload reduction

BWH #:  26865550 

Dear Dr. Beraha (Nate): 

We had the pleasure of seeing Lena Antonio in the Outpatient Division of the Boston Adult Congenital Heart and Pulmonary Hypertension Service at our Brigham and Women's Clinic site on the 17th of September, 2013.  As you well know, Lena is a 23-year-old woman with truncus arteriosus, VSD and double chamber RV.  She underwent initial surgery in 1989 with truncal valve repair and an RV to PA conduit, ventricular muscle bundle resection and VSD closure.  She then underwent redo truncal valve repair and tricuspid valve repair in 2002 followed by repeat truncal valve repair and tricuspid valve repair in 2005 as well as replacement of her RV to PA conduit with a 33-mm Hancock bioprosthesis.  She was lost somewhat to follow up in the interim and then returned in 2010 reportedly with relatively poor ventricular systolic function and moderate truncal valve regurgitation.  Her full medical problem list is at the end of this correspondence. 

Lena has been extremely compliant returning to clinic visit at every request.  We have continued to speak to her about concerns over her biventricular dysfunction and next steps ensuring she was able to maintain interval visits.  She is an extremely mature 23-year-old woman and presents at this time on her own.   


Lena reports that she in general has been relatively stable.  She continues to work as a pipefitter for Electric Boat building submarines for government use, but since her trip to the hospital in May, they have been limiting the physicality of her efforts and she has been spending quite a bit of time at the computer which she does not particularly enjoy.  Of note, she had been a manager at D'Angelo's and finds this job much more fulfilling than working in the food industry.   


Lena continues to have episodes of chest pains that happen a few times a day though very short-lived.  They then trigger panic attacks which can be much more severe with sweating and overall feelings of unwellness and tachycardia.  She takes no medications for her panic attacks and feels strongly she will be able to deal with these.  She has not had other episodes of chest pain.  She is short of breath at approximately one flight of stairs.  She has had no syncope.  She notes no peripheral edema.  She does have palpitations that make her uncomfortable, but do not make her feel unwell.  Sleeping is an issue for her as she has nightmares every night.  She has not had episodes of orthopnea nor paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Lena is thirsty much of the time and drinks a very high volume of fluids, liters a day which she enjoys.  She responds briskly to her Lasix and has not noticed increased peripheral edema or abdominal swelling.  


She has made a tremendous effort at increasing her exercise as we discussed in the past.  She has been walking much more though is not quite clear how she is going to be able to exercise once the cold weather starts.  She bowls which she enjoys tremendously but the bending over and picking up the ball can make her quite short of breath. She is researching a venue for other indoor exercise. 

Current medications are Vasotec 5 mg by mouth daily, Carvedilol 6.25 mg by mouth twice daily, Depo-Provera injections every three months, Lasix 20 mg by mouth once a day. 

Allergies:  No known drug allergies. 

Social History:  She continues to live on her own.  She had had quite an active party life in the summer drinking a number of beers in an evening but more recently has cut back to one beer a day.  She does not smoke cigarettes, uses no recreational drugs and practices safe sex. 

She is fiercely independent.  At her last visit, her mom accompanied her but she presents alone today having worked until midnight and then got up early to drive here and is quite fatigued. 

Review of systems: She frequently awakes with severe bilateral leg cramps that take a bit of time to resolve.  Otherwise interval review of systems is noncontributory. 

On examination, Lena was initially sleeping when we entered the examination room as she worked the night before but woke up and was appropriately interactive throughout the visit.  Her heart rate was 78 and regular.  Her blood pressure on the right was 97/69.  Respiratory rate was 10.  Weight was 142 pounds which is 64.4 kg up 2.3 kg from her last visit which was at the end of August.  Height 164 cm.  BMI of 23.8.  Pupils were equal and active.  Oropharynx had reasonable oral health.  No obvious areas of infection.  Neck was supple.  Jugular venous pressure appeared to be approximately eight.  Carotid upstrokes were brisk.  Thyroid tissue could not be felt.  She had no resting tremor.  Lungs were clear bilaterally to percussion and auscultation with equal excursion without rales, rhonchi or wheezing.  Cardiac examination revealed a very hyperdynamic precordium and a diffusely very active point of maximal impulse.  S1 was crisp.  S2 was crisp and all sounds were quite loud.  She had a 2/6 systolic outflow tract murmur and a very early diastolic murmur heard only at the left axillary line.  No diastolic murmur could be heard anteriorly.  There was no S3 and no S4.  She has frequent extrasystoles.  Abdomen was soft.  Bowel sounds were present.  There was no hepatosplenomegaly. There was no radial-femoral delay.  Extremities were warm and well-perfused without edema.  It is noted that she has a number of old cutdown sites in the right radial area with slightly decreased right radial pulse and cutdown site on her left ankle.  A  small left radial site but the left radial pulse is quite active. 

Resting electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with a first-degree AV block measuring 240 msec.  There were frequent premature atrial complexes.  There was a normal axis of 73.  There was a left bundle branch block with a QRS duration of 186 msec.  There was also RV and RV strain pattern. 

In summary,  Lena Antonio is a 23-year-old woman with truncus arteriosus with an RV to PA conduit, minimal conduit stenosis and minimal regurgitation but moderate truncal valve regurgitation with the MRI measuring 23% regurgitant fraction and a severely dilated LV with a Z-score of 15 and depressed LV function of 28% with depressed RV function of 43%.  Her exercise tolerance test a few weeks ago here demonstrated that her peak O2 pulse was at 58% thereby determining a low VO2 at 16.2 mL per kg per minute 49%.  It is noticed that the change between that exercise test and that in 2012 was related not so much to the peak O2 pulse but more so related to the heart rate which has come down somewhat on her beta blocker.  Her heart failure regimen is somewhat limited by her borderline blood pressure at this time in the 90s. We had a greater than hour and a half visit today with Lena focusing on the severity of her ventricular dysfunction and potential interventions for such.  She understands that cardiac transplantation remains an option and that ideally we would like to put off the timing for this and then discussed at much greater detail, the potential for cardiac resynchronization therapy with a concomitant internal cardiac defibrillator for primary prevention given her significant LV dysfunction.  Lena was able to tolerate this discussion and thereby we invited our colleague, Dr. Dominic Abrams, to see her today in our clinic, the electrophysiologist who would be able to perform her cardiac resynchronization therapy.  

Dr. Abrams spent greater than half an hour with Lena and described that though data for congenital heart patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy is somewhat limited in patients such as herself who do have a left bundle branch block, it is certainly thought she would make a good candidate for such.  He explained that 70% of patients after cardiac resynchronization therapy feel better, have more exercise and we would suggest proceeding with this.  She listened thoughtfully, had excellent questions, asked particularly what would happen if the cardiac resynchronization therapy did not work and it was explained that she would be no worse off save for having undergone a procedure. 

We saw her also with Dr. Emer Joyce, Cardiology Heart Failure Fellow who is very interested in participating in Lena's care and a natural progression of the care would be to involve the heart failure service and we are hopeful that Dr. Joyce would be able to participate in that. 

We recognize that this was a difficult discussion for Lena though she was absolutely able to participate throughout.  We have given her all of our contact information and are hopeful that she will contact us or we will contact her with any further questions or concerns she has.  We will proceed with scheduling the EP procedure given her wish to proceed.  In any case we have scheduled a routine return visit in eight weeks for either further discussions or followup post procedure. 

Sincerely, 

Disty Pearson PA-C 

Dear Dr. Beraha and Dr. Joyce: 

It was a pleasure seeing Lena today in clinic.  We admire her maturity in discussing these difficult issues with the profundity of her cardiovascular disease.  She understands and we are happy to explain this to any of her designated significant supporters if she so wishes.  She has all of our contact information and knows to call us if she has increased palpitations.  She also understands to call 9-1-1 if she has prolonged arrhythmia that makes her feel unwell.  The transcription above by Disty Pearson PA-C reflects our combined thoughts from today's 80 minute face to face medical encounter, > 80% of which was spent orchestrating EP follow and device planning, reviewing nature of heart failure, progression potentials for such, potentials of CRT, ICD and implications risks and benefits of such. We will be in greater touch as we progress towards such, increasing our vigilance and education with Lena.  Thanks for allowing us to partner with you in her care.

Sincerely, 

Michael Landzberg, MD

Ambulated 200 feet over level surface with 5 standing rests 


Gait: Slow gait speed, decreased step length throughout  

Therex: Interval ambulation, total of 200 ft intervals with standing rests, back supported against wall, verbal cues for thoracic extension and deep breathing.  

Education: educated patient regarding importance of pacing during ambulation, importance of rests standing and sitting. Recommendations for mobilizing OOB with RN 3x per day. Pt verbalized agreement with plan.  


Communication: Discussed progress and coordination of care with RN  


A: Patient demonstrates a flat BP response and a normal HR response to activity over level surfaces. He was primarily limited by fatigue with mobility. He was able to progress to standing rests during interval ambulation.  Anticipate patient will be able to progress towards home discharge with follow up home PT upon discharge from MGH.  PT will continue to follow while pt remains in house.  


P: progress interval gait, assess stairs (4 steps with railing)  unable to be disconnected from IV therefore unable to assess stairs today.  



RECOMMENDATIONS 

	  Discharge: Home PT  Recommendations: S ambulation shorter distances more frequently throughout day ~ 200 feet with frequent standing rests

ASSESSMENT/RECOMMENDATIONS: 


66-year-old M with a history of significant ischemic cardiomyopathy and urinary retention since July. He is not currently a good candidate for a bladder outlet procedure given his cardiomyopathy. 


- Would not treat UCx unless pt is symptomatic or has secondary signs of infection such as fever or leukocytosis, or is undergoing a procedure which requires his urine to be sterile.  

- Start Finasteride 5mg QD. This will not help with retention in the acute setting, but may help subsequently.  

- If the pt's blood pressure is ever able to tolerate it, would consider Flomax 0.4mg QHS  

- Would suggest a void trial to assess the pt's voiding function: Do not replace Foley catheter unless the pt becomes uncomfortable or has more than 1L in his bladder. 

- Will follow 

Discussed with Dr. Deshmukh

Palliative Care Service Consultation  

Date: 2/4/15 

Time: 12:00 pm 


Admission Date: 1/29/15 

Attending/Referring physician: Kimberly Parks, MD/Andrea Martins, NP 

Primary cardiologist at MGH: Kimberly Parks, MD 


Reason for Consultation: dyspnea management; debility/goals of care 


HPI:   

Information for this consultation was gathered from a review of the medical record and interviews with the patient nurse, and referring NP.  


Mr. John "Jack" Duarte, Jr. is a 66-year-old gentleman with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, DM, COPD, CKD, BPH and HLD admitted from cardiology clinic, where he was seeking a second opinion, for management of volume overload and tailoring of his heart failure medication regimen. He is s/p right heart catheterization on 2/2/15, which revealed high filling pressures and total occlusion of LAD. Jack was found to have urinary retention in July 2014 secondary to BPH and was scheduled for a TURP, but this was postponed due to an MI and August 2014. He has had an indwelling catheter since July, last changed a few weeks ago. Jack had no known cardiac history until his MI last August. At that time, he was found to have total occlusion of his LAD and had 2 stents placed. He was discharged to a 3 week stay in rehab, during which he experienced an acute exacerbation of HF leading to hospitalization. He has not had any further hospitalization since then, but his quality of life has been poor, with significant DOE and weakness. Jack recently enrolled in hospice as he felt there were no further treatment options. We are consulted to assist with goals of care conversations.

Palliative Care Review 

Jack is familiar with palliative care and the ways in which it differs from hospice. He is very enthusiastic about his experience with hospice before this admission. "They took great care of me. I was doing really well." He feels they were managing his symptoms well and taking excellent care of him while also providing some companionship (volunteers to read to him, etc.). He reports that he came to MGH because his daughter Alyson "thought there must be something else somebody could do." He was going to cancel the visit with Dr. Parks because of the snow and because "I figured I was dying anyway," but then felt that it was important to his family that he get a second opinion. He appears to have a well-developed understanding of his illness, prognosis, and hospital course. He knows that currently the team is trying to "gather more data," including the cardiac MRI, and then will make a decision about his options, but he has a sense that there is probably nothing else to be done. In that case, he feels very strongly that he would want to return home with hospice (he believes his former hospice was Southcoast).  


Jack denies any dyspnea at this time, and reports not having DOE when walking short distances. He endorses that when walking down the hall with PT yesterday, he felt quite SOB. Had been using 3-4L O2 at home in the last few months, but currently is not requiring O2. Endorses some mild muscular/R chest wall pain that he believes is related to having lifted 2lb weights at home. SL morphine was very helpful for dyspnea at home, but he doesn't feel this helped his pain. He fears being in pain at the end of his life. Denies any N/V, changes in appetite. Feels constipation and like he hasn't had a "good" BM in about a week, though has been passing flatus and small BMs in the last few days.

Present Illness:   

Asked to see this 66 year old man who was admitted for evaluation of an ischemic cardiomyopathy following an anterior myocardial infarction last August.  


He estimates that he has had diabetes for about 30 years, taking insulin for at about 20 years. He has been in and out of the hospital and rehab and is not entirely clear on his insulin regimens. He was taking Humalog 75/25 insulin twice a day before his hospitalizations but was switched to Levemir 17 Units at bedtime and Humalog before meals (? 6 Units). His A1c is 8%. 

Retinopathy:   He has had laser OU for retinopathy and there has been discussion of intraocular injections. He can read with reading glasses. 

Nephropathy:  BUN/Cr have risen from 39/1.44 on admission to 52/1.92 today. His urinalysis has 1+ protein. 

Neuropathy:    He takes gabapentin for peripheral neuropathy 

Cardiac:           He did not have a cardiac history prior to his AMI last August, following which he had rotoblade and BMS placement to his LAD. Since then, she has had significant dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea.

Balance: Fairly steady gait with RW, one loss of balance laterally but able to recover. Does better when maintaining focus on task. Tends to become easily distracted and that is when he loses his balance. Verbal cues for increasing RW proximity to assist in balance 

Gait: Slow gait speed, decreased step length throughout  

Therex: Interval ambulation, 100 ft intervals with seated rest x3 

Education: educated patient regarding mobilizing with RN doing shorter walks instead of walking all at once to increase endurance  

Communication: Discussed progress with RN, NP  


A: John was able to progress distance ambulated today with slight SOB. He continues to tolerate shorter distances with seated rest to improve functional endurance. From hemodynamic perspective he has an appropriate increase in HR with mobility but relatively flat BP increase pre and post mobility. Had difficultly determining ambulatory BP due to inability to auscultate and autocuff inability to make a determination. Anticipate patient will be able to progress towards home discharge with follow up home PT upon discharge from MGH.   

P: progress interval gait, assess stairs (4 steps with railing)  



RECOMMENDATIONS 

	  Discharge: Home PT  Recommendations: S ambulation shorter distances more frequently throughout day ~ 100 ftx3 with seated rest

A: John was able to progress distance ambulated today without any fatigue or shortness of breath, which is improved since initial evaluation. He tolerated multiple shorter distances with rest much better than continuous ambulation, though demonstrated flat BP response with mobility; patient asymptomatic. Patient to go for diagnostic catheterization later today. Anticipate patient will be able to progress towards home discharge with follow up home PT in 1-2 more PT Sessions.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 ischemic cardiomyopathy for CRT-D

 Interval History:

 66-year-old gentleman with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, DM, COPD, CKD, BPH and HLD referred for consideration for CRT-D. 
Clearly Class III NYHA with a wide QRS, with extensive scarring of his heart. He has a pure RBBB with a duration of 158 ms. 
He has had an indwelling catheter since July that was last changed a few weeks ago. 

In terms of his cardiac history, he had no history of cardiac disease until August of last year, at which time he developed diaphoresis, shortness of breath and fluttering in his abdomen. He denied chest pain and palpitations. He presented to Charlton emergency department on 8/17/14 as a late presentation anterior MI, and was taken emergently to the catheter lab where he was noted to have a total occlusion of his LAD. He underwent rotoblade and placement of 2 bare-metal stents. His angiogram report does not delineate his remaining anatomy, and it is unclear whether there are other, nonobstructive lesions present per notes, (no report unavailable at this time). His hospitalization was followed by a 3 week stay in rehabilitation, during which he had an episode of acute decompensated heart failure leading to hospitalization. Since then, he has not had any further hospitalizations, however, he has had a very poor quality of life with significant dyspnea on exertion and weakness. He had recently elected to enroll in hospice, stating that there was nothing more that could be done for him. 

Prior to his MI, he and his daughter tell me he was quite active. He was doing yard work, working for U-Haul doing some physical labor without any difficulty. He could climb stairs without any trouble and could walk a mile without difficulty. He had rare dyspnea on exertion. Currently, he has intermittent orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He has had lower extremity edema in the past but not today. He gets dyspnea with minimal exertion including with conversations today. He is quite weak and spends most of his time in a wheelchair. 

He has been on oxygen at home prn 3-4L for the last 4 months. 


 Past medical history:
 Ischemic cardiomyopathy, status post LAD stent 8/17/14 
DM on insulin >10yrs 
+retinopaty 
+neuropathy 
+nephropathy 
COPD 
chronic kidney disease. 
Depression. 
CKD possibly related to diabetes and medication noncompliance. 
BPH with urinary retention, requiring indwelling catheter. 
Hyperlipidemia 

Medications on Admission: 
1. Acetylsalicylic Acid (Aspirin) (Aspirin) 81 MG PO QD 
2. Atorvastatin 80 MG PO QHS 
3. Clopidogrel (Plavix) 75 MG PO QD 
4. Furosemide (Lasix) 20 MG PO BID 
5. Gabapentin 300 MG PO BID 
6. Insulin Detemir (Levemir) 17 units SC QHS 
7. Lorazepam (Ativan) 0.5 MG PO Q8H 
8. Metolazone (Zaroxolyn) 2.5 MG PO QD 
9. Pantoprazole (Protonix) 40 MG PO QD 
10. Prochlorperazine Maleate (Compazine ) PO BID prn nausea 
11. Sertraline (Zoloft) 200 mg PO QD 
12. Tiotropium (Spiriva) 18 MCG INH QD 
13. Trazodone 75 mg PO QHS 
14. Warfarin Sodium 5 MG PO QPM

Vital Signs: Pulse 91 bpm
  resp. rate 18 BPM
  BP 108/70 mmHg

Physical examination: 
-Abdomen: Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.
-Cardiac: Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 or S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.
-Chest: bibasilar crackles in bases
-Neck: +2 carotids without bruit bilateral, JVD 12 cm H2O
-Skin: No rashes, anicteric. Multiple ecchymosis on bilateral upper extermities, skin tear on right forearm
-General: No acute distress. Chronically ill appearing
-HEENT: Unremarkable

 Assessment and plan:
 Mr. Duarte is a 66 year old gentleman with LVEF of 17%, ischemic CMP, QRS of 158 ms and extensive scarring of his myocardium. He is on schedule for a RHC LHC. 
He clearly meets all indications for CRT, however has a very low likelihood of response due to his comorbidities and especially due to his his scarred Anterior wall and poor RV function. On evaluation of his echocardiogram, the only segment that is contracting is the lateral wall. 
We will review the need for a CRT-D on compassionate grounds. If he is willing we might enroll him in the ENHANCE-CRT study. 
Thank you for alowing us to participate in his care.

EVALUATION:   

PT dx: Patient presents with impaired aerobic capacity and endurance associated with cardiovascular pump dysfunction.  


Pt presents with primary physical therapy impairments in muscle performance, balance, gait, and aerobic capacity.  These impairments impact the patients ability to perform functional mobility and ADL tasks at his prior baseline level however are likely reflective of more recent baseline mobility. With initiation of level ground ambulation pt demonstrates asymptomatic appropriate hemodynamic response however fatigues easily likely related in part to limited mobility over hospitalization and PTA. Anticipate w/ ongoing medical management, increased OOB mobility w/ Nursing staff and participation in PT that pt will demonstrate improved activity tolerance and achieve functional goals necessary to access and negotiate his home in ~2-3 PT sessions. Pending goals of care, recommend f/u home PT to optimize functional independence in the home and community environments and continued baseline social supports for bathing and IADL completion. Positive prognostic factors for functional recovery include social supports, knowldge of rehab, and pt motivation. Factors that may negatively impact the patients rate of functional recovery include age, co-morbidities, and environmental barriers.  


Anticipated Goals and Expected Outcomes: (within 7 days)  

1.       The pt will transition supine to sitting independently with HOB flat, no rail using logroll technique to facilitate the patients ability to independently mobilize out of bed at home 

2.       The pt will stand pivot transfer bed to chair with RW independently to facilitate the patients ability to independently mobilize out of bed at home 

3.       The pt will ambulate >200 w/ RW independently in order to promote the patients ability to maneuver independently at home 

4.       The pt will negotiate 4 stairs with unilateral rail support, and supervision in order to gain access to his home 

5.       The pt will be independent with 3 LE exercises to promote increased LE strength in order to facilitate ability to mobilize with reduced assistance 

6.       Patient verbalizes understanding of proper termination of exercise  

7.       Patient verbalizes understanding of pacing strategies 


Goals/Plan discussed with and agreed to by patient and family?     Yes      

 Plan of Care*:       Frequency:  4x/wk 

         Bed mobility training- logroll technique, minimizing reliance on adjustable bed features 

         Transfer training w/ emphasis on safety 

         Gait training: using walker progressing distance/frequency 

         Stair training: unilateral rail w/ emphasis on pacing 

         Patient Education: OOB recommendations, use of RPE/DOE/talk test for activity monitoring, signs/symptoms for activity termination, modifiable risk factors for heart, benefits of regular aerobic/strength training program in cardiac disease prevention 

         Therapeutic Exercise for strengthening: B Hip and knee flexion/extension, eccentric quad control 



*The patients progress will be assessed at each session. The frequency may be increased or tapered as treatment progresses based on the therapists judgment of factors including but not limited to; co morbidities, tissue healing, patient/caregiver independent self management, ability to participate  in/receive therapy due to medical stability and/or competing care priorities.

 Reason for visit:
 ischemic cardiomyopathy admission for Dr. Parks

 Interval History:
 Interval history taken from Dr. Parks admission note, interview with patient and speaking with his daughter on the phone. 

In brief: Mr. Duarte who likes to be referred to as Jack, is a 66-year-old gentleman with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, DM, COPD, CKD, BPH and HLD who was seen by Dr. Parks today for a second opinion on options of is ischemic cardiomyopathy. 

He was found to have urinary retention in July of 2014 due to BPH with a plan for possible TURP that was postponed due to MI in August 2014. He has had an indwelling catheter since July that was last changed a few weeks ago. 

In terms of his cardiac history, he had no history of cardiac disease until August of last year, at which time he developed diaphoresis, shortness of breath and fluttering in his abdomen. He denied chest pain and palpitations. He presented to Charlton emergency department on 8/17/14 as a late presentation anterior MI, and was taken emergently to the catheter lab where he was noted to have a total occlusion of his LAD. He underwent rotoblade and placement of 2 bare-metal stents. His angiogram report does not delineate his remaining anatomy, and it is unclear whether there are other, nonobstructive lesions present per notes, (no report unavailable at this time). His hospitalization was followed by a 3 week stay in rehabilitation, during which he had an episode of acute decompensated heart failure leading to hospitalization. Since then, he has not had any further hospitalizations, however, he has had a very poor quality of life with significant dyspnea on exertion and weakness. He had recently elected to enroll in hospice, stating that there was nothing more that could be done for him. 

Prior to his MI, he and his daughter tell me he was quite active. He was doing yard work, working for U-Haul doing some physical labor without any difficulty. He could climb stairs without any trouble and could walk a mile without difficulty. He had rare dyspnea on exertion. Currently, he has intermittent orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He has had lower extremity edema in the past but not today. He gets dyspnea with minimal exertion including with conversations today. He is quite weak and spends most of his time in a wheelchair. 

He has been on oxygen at home prn 3-4L for the last 4 months. 

On arrival to Ellison 11, the patient was hemodynamically stable. On interview, the patient confirmed the above mentioned symptoms of shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. His associated symptoms is dizziness. He has had multiple falls in the past with the last one being a couple weeks ago resulting in a skin tear on his right forearm. In addition, the patient noted having difficulty swallowing. He does not modify his diet or cough after eating/drinking. He has not had this further assessed before. Cardiac review of systems is negative for angina, palpitations or claudication. 

Of note patient has a vague recollection of his some of his recent medical events and his daughter Alyson who lives with him is very involved with is care can be reached at (401) 391-1060 to answer any questions. Being a cardiac patient is relatively new within 6 months and will need further nutrition guidance, requesting salt with dinner.

Ischemic cardiomyopathy .. - Acute on Chronic systolic heart failure. 
Currently he is clinically quite volume overloaded. He will be admitted for further evaluation of his dyspnea and for tailoring of his heart failure medical regimen. Will hold warfarin and preparation for a right heart catheterization, which will likely be done on Monday.
For now, will give Lasix 80 IV b.i.d.
Obtain basic labs including a comprehensive metabolic panel, CBC with differential, proBNP, TSH, hemoglobin A1c
if potassium less than 5, will start Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.
Obtain 2-D echocardiogram to assess LV function.
Chest x-ray.
Pulmonary function tests.
Please consult palliative care, Todd Hultman NP PhD

S:. Follow-up on emergency room visit one 4/5/04 regarding syncope 


The patient had been scheduled to get parietal quadrant ultrasound to check on his liver; was told to too fast for eight hours at a time but somehow understood this to mean 18 hours. He presented to the hospital and on his way to see ultrasound, walking down the hallway, started to feel woozy, which is not uncommon for him. 

Without further warning he found himself on the floor and coming to, Harry had no idea that he was going to faint. 

He was taken from the hospital quarter to be emergency room where his labs were checked, an EKG was done, and the cardiac service was consulted: there was no cardiac event recorded on his AICD and the conclusion was that he was likely dehydrated. 

Patient was told that his potassium was slightly low and he presents today for follow-up and requests that his potassium be rechecked. 

Patient reports that he is completely back to his previous syncope baseline in terms of how he has been feeling. 

Patient continues to be troubled by his inability to taste food fully; it is effortful for him to it and he is concerned that at 148 he does not weigh as much as would be healthy for him. He eats three meals a day and tries to add high-calorie snacks. 


His cardiologist, Dr. Guiney has put him on Lasix and he feels this has caused great improvement in his general well-being. 


Patient reports that he has continued to feel woozy from time to time, as he had previously, but has had no further fainting. He had never previously fainted in his life.

P:. Check CBC as patient has been consistently slightly anemic; recheck LFTs and reschedule or a courtroom ultrasound. 

Check chem seven and hemoglobin A1 C. as well as TSH; we will call with results when available. 

We will look for information on high calorie food sources and send it if we can find anything useful.

Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island

Dear Ryan, 


I had the pleasure of caring for Mark Mello during the latter portion of his hospitalization at Brigham and Women's for evaluation and management of dilated cardiomyopathy and acute on chronic systolic heart failure.  As you know, he is a 48-year-old gentleman who has had longstanding dilated cardiomyopathy with variable adherence to his neurohormonal regimen.  In addition, he has insulin-dependent diabetes that in the past has been poorly controlled and contributed to peripheral neuropathy and prior toe amputation for ulceration.  He has had chronic atrial fibrillation and has been variably on Tikosyn, which had previously controlled his rhythm.  Other pertinent comorbidities include anxiety and depression.  He had presented to Memorial with heart failure and was placed on milrinone.  After some optimization medically, he underwent a right heart catheterization on 0.2 of milrinone, which revealed a right atrial pressure of 5, PA of 39/21 with a mean of 27 and a wedge of 12, a Fick cardiac output of 4.36 and an index of 2.1 while on milrinone 0.2 mcg/kg per minute.  He was reviewed by our multidisciplinary committee and was felt not to be a candidate for transplant due to prior nonadherence, poorly controlled diabetes and his own ambivalence.  We felt the same way about LVAD at this time, particularly because of the patient's limited supports and his reluctance to consider permanent outpatient support.  He was weaned off milrinone successfully with the aid of hydralazine and Isordil and was stable on oral diuretics.  He was ambulating without lightheadedness or shortness of breath despite persistent atrial fibrillation with poorly controlled ventricular response up to 120 beats per minute.  We loaded upon amiodarone and digoxin in the hope of rate controlling him.  He underwent a TEE on 09/30/14, but unfortunately had a left atrial appendage thrombus, though could not be cardioverted.  Accordingly, we will defer the decision on implantable left electrical therapies.  We recommend repeat discontinue cardioversion attempt after TEE guidance in early 11/20/14 at Memorial Hospital.  If at that time, he had persistent atrial fibrillation, we can do an AV junctional ablation and CRT-D placement.  If he maintains sinus rhythm, though I think it is a small contributor to his cardiomyopathy, he could in theory be above the range where ICD were needed.  Accordingly, he was fitted with a LifeVest prior to discharge. 


Several tests were performed as part of his advanced therapy evaluation.  Pulmonary function testing was performed during his hospital stay, which revealed an FEV1 of 2.7 liters or 73% predicted.  He had a DLCO corrected for ventilation of 87% predicted and otherwise good effort.  Other ancillary test during his hospital stay included normal liver function tests.  He had a normal TSH of 2.95, hemoglobin A1c of 11.9, hematocrit of 49.7. 


At the time of discharge, his heart rate was 95 beats per minute in atrial fibrillation with a blood pressure of 110/60.  He is saturating 98% on room air.  His dry weight was 94.0 kilograms and with that he had a potassium of 4.5, BUN of 24 and creatinine of 1.21.  His discharge INR was 3.1 on warfarin.  His INR will be followed by the MHRI Coumadin Clinic.  A full list of medications is available in the housestaff discharge summary. 


We have arranged followup for Mr. Mello on Wednesday, 10/08/14 at 10 a.m. at Memorial Hospital with Dr. Broderick.  We will arrange interval INR check on Friday, 10/03/14.  In addition, I am happy to follow up with Mr. Mello for further conversations about advanced cardiac therapies, specifically destination therapy LVAD, at our average Clinic at Kent Hospital in Warwick, Rhode Island.  I will enjoy working together on his care.  It was a pleasure for looking after Mr. Mello during his stay at the Brigham.  Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions or concerns.

BW/F PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION FOLLOWUP NOTE              


PATIENT NAME:  Mello, Mark    MR #:   29718822    DATE:  9/30/14      TIME:   2:10 PM                     


HPI:     Patient seen in followup for management of depressed mood and coping with heart failure. Today, Mr. Mello went for TEE and cardioversion, but cardioversion could not be done due to visualized clot. Mr. Mello reports that he is frustrated with his hospitalization, but overall coping well. He says that his mood has been "good". He continues to have poor sleep, sleeping only 1-2 hours per night. He reports being glad that he has not required IV inotropic support, but is currently willing to consider IV inotropes or VAD if they should be recommended. 


Since last seen, Mr. Mello has been tapered off of fluoxetine and onto duloxetine 60mg po daily. He does report decreased libido/sexual dysfunction, however the cause of this is unclear, as it could be related to duloxetine, cardiac medications or his diabetes/cardiac disease. 


EXAM:  Young man with dark hair and glasses, sitting up in a chair, awake and alert, pleasant and cooperative with interview. Eye contact fair. Speech fluent, appears much more talkative and interactive today. Normal speech rate/volume. Mood "good" Affect appears to be full in range, reactive. Thought process is linear. Thought content is without current hopelessness or suicidality. Some rigidity in this thinking. Insight improved. Judgment fair. 


IMPRESSION:    Mr. Mello is a 43 year old man with a past medical history significant for heart failure and poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes who is admitted for management of decompensated non-ischemic heart failure and consideration of advanced treatment options, with chronic symptoms of depression which have historically been poorly responsive to medication management.  Mr. Mello reports that he feels better both physically and mentally, is happy that he is doing well off of milrinone but is  able to consider treatment options.   


DIAGNOSIS:     MDD, recurrent, moderate 


RECOMMENDATIONS:        

Continue duloxetine to 60mg po daily. 

Would continue to educate patient about potential treatment options. He expresses a strong interest in seeing what a Hickman catheter looks like. 

Would continue to educate patient about the need for adherence with medications, fluid restriction and salt restriction. 

Will follow, call with questions.

 Narrative Note:
 POST PROCEDURE FOLLOW UP NOTE

Mrs. Mackinnon is doing well tonight post BIV ICD implantation. She was worried about local erythema around the implant site and has some tenderness there as well when touching it or moving her arm.

BP 123/62 mmHg; HR 85 bpm 

Well appearing, comfortable in bed; 
CRTD dressing is clean, dry and intact;
there is very mild tenderness to palpation and no visible hematoma or active bleeding;
there is erythema along the border of the dressing consistent with early ecchymosis.

Telemetry: no events post procedure today; A-sensed / BiV-paced
CXR: CRT-D leads positioned in the RA, RV and CS/LV; no pneumothorax

Mrs. Mackinnon is a 75 year-old woman with CTX-induced CM (despite optimized GDMT her EF remains low with NYHA class III) who is status post CRT-D implantation this afternoon (axillary BoSci CRT-D; she is enrolled in MADIT CHIC. 
Due to intermittent hypotension during case possibly associated with CS dissection a bedside TTE and a follow-up TTE on the ward were performed - both negative for effusion. 
Plan: continue vanco; CXR and interrogation in AM; discuss timing of follow-up TTE as needed.

CONTACT INFORMATION:  (508) 655-5175 

PCP: WILLIAM C LIAW 

REASON FOR ADMISSSION: s/p ICD 


HPI: 

75F non-ischemic cardiomyopathy 22 chemotherapy vs. myocarditis (most recent LVEF 28% in 11/14), LBBB, HTN, HLD, R Breast Ca s/p lumpectomy, chemotherapy with adriamycin via left chest wall port and radiation and depression presents s/p CRT-D placement for CHF. 


Per last cardiology note:  

Non ischemic cardiomyopathy .. - The etiology of her cardiomyopathy may well be secondary to chemotherapy. She has class III  heart failure by her symptoms and has a LBBB (QRS ~ 150 ms) on ECG with LVEF that has fluctuated around 35%. Her recent TTE shows an EF that appears to be 35% on our review. She meets criteria for CRT-D and is amenable to proceeding. . 


Cardiac History per initial cardiology visit note:  

Her cardiac history began with the discovery of a cardiomyopathy with  EF 25% on TTE in 7/11 in the context of a LBBB on ECG. A pharmacologic MIBI showed a mid to distal anteroseptal to apical infarct and EF 36%. At the time she had only mild DOE with significant exertion. She underwent right heart catheterization and coronary angiogram in 8/11 with no overt evidence of CAD and normal filling pressures. Although she had received adriamycin for breast cancer, her cardiac MRI in 8/11 showed moderate global hypokinesis with associated myocardial T2 edema and global relative myocardial enhancement, criteria which are consistent with myocarditis with LVEF 43%. She was enrolled in cardiac rehab and initiated medical therapy. Her symptoms persisted with dyspnea with stairs or carrying significant weight. She did not improve with the initiation of diuretics but has not been hospitalized for heart failure. She underwent a level III CPET in 4/12 that showed a likely cardiac limitation with normal filling pressures with peak vO2 of 14.3 cc/kg/min and it was felt that she likely had mild chronotropic incompetance due to failure to augment her stroke volume appropriately with exercise in the setting of normal 

filling pressures, but additionally her RVEF decreased with exercise and her LVIDed decreased and she was felt to have a peripheral limitation in exercise due to anemia. She was transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol without improvement in her symptoms which remained NYHA Class II-III in nature. Previously, she had two syncope events in 7/08 that occurred with exertion after rapidly changing position and in 11/09 that occurred upon standing. Her EF was normal on TTE in 2008. She had a third episode of syncope in 6/13 that was attributed to orthostasis in the setting of lisinopril titration. In 5/14, she noted worsening dyspnea with 10-15 minutes of exertion, especially with stairs, as well as mild LE edema. LVEF at the time was 35%. Most recently, her LVEF was 38% on TTE in 9/14 with stable class III symptoms. A recent ECG showed NSR with a rate of 77 with LBBB with QRS of 154 ms. She has been referred for evaluation for device therapy.

PERTINENT PAST CARDIOLOGY STUDIES:  

TTE (11/2014) 

MITRAL VALVE  

There is no evidence of mitral valve prolapse. There is mild mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler. 


LEFT ATRIUM  

There is no evidence of left atrial dilatation. 


AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT  

There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis. There is evidence of trace aortic insufficiency by color and spectral Doppler. The aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva is 32 mm (normal: less than 40 mm). 


LEFT VENTRICLE  

The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular systolic function is moderately to severely impaired. The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic with regional variation. The basal and mid lateral walls are best preserved. There is a false tendon within the LV cavity which is a normal variant. The estimated ejection fraction is 28 %. LVEF was measured by the single dimension method. 


TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC  

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency. 


PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A.  

There is an insufficient tricuspid regurgitation Doppler profile to estimate an RV systolic pressure. 


RIGHT VENTRICLE  

The right ventricle is not dilated. The right ventricular systolic function is within normal limits. 


PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES  

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion. 


CONCLUSIONS  

Compared to the report of 9/2/2014, the estimated LV ejection fraction has decreased from 38% to 28%.

 Narrative Note:
 Mrs. MacKinnon is a pleasant 75-year-old female with past chemotherapy exposure and subsequent chemotherapy induced cardiomyopathy. Her echo today indicates that her LV function is reduced at 28% with LVIDed 50 mm and LVIDes 41 mm with moderate to severely impaired LV function. Her LV function continues to deteriorate with her prior reading 38%.

She is on optimal medical heart failure regime as her blood pressure has not tolerated much more in terms of oral therapy such as aldosterone or Lasix. She gets shortness of breath if she walks fast but is able to walk slowly.

She continues NYHA class III and is being processed for CRT implantation. She has an underlying left bundle branch block.

 Education/Counselling:
 Discussed importance of regular heart failure monitoring. Provided with education regarding CRT therapy and follow up.

Dear colleagues,

Reason for Visit: Cardiac Arrhythmia Service

 It was a pleasure to meet Ms. MacKinnon in the MGH Cardiac Arrhythmia Service Clinic. She is a 75 year old woman with a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy due to myocarditis or chemotherapy (most recent LVEF 38% in 9/14), LBBB, HTN, hyperlipidemia, right breast cancer s/p lumpectomy, chemotherapy with adriamycin via left chest wall port and radiation and depression who presents for evaluation for device therapy. Her cardiac history began with the discovery of a cardiomyopathy with EF 25% on TTE in 7/11 in the context of a LBBB on ECG. A pharmacologic MIBI showed a mid to distal anteroseptal to apical infarct and EF 36%. At the time she had only mild DOE with significant exertion. She underwent right heart catheterization and coronary angiogram in 8/11 with no overt evidence of CAD and normal filling pressures. Although she had received adriamycin for breast cancer, her cardiac MRI in 8/11 showed moderate global hypokinesis with associated myocardial T2 edema and global relative myocardial enhancement, criteria which are consistent with myocarditis with LVEF 43%. She was enrolled in cardiac rehab and initiated medical therapy. Her symptoms persisted with dyspnea with stairs or carrying significant weight. She did not improve with the initiation of diuretics but has not been hospitalized for heart failure.

Today she endorses ongoing dyspnea with stairs, carrying heavy loads or sustained rapid activity for 10-15 minutes. She has been walking slowly on her treadmill for about 20 minutes a couple of times per week. She has positional lightheadedness but no recent syncope on her current medications. She denies orthopnea, PND, palpitations, chest discomfort and LE edema.

Non ischemic cardiomyopathy .. - The etiology of her cardiomyopathy may well be secondary to chemotherapy. She has class III heart failure by her symptoms and has a LBBB (QRS ~ 150 ms) on ECG with LVEF that has fluctuated around 35%. Her recent TTE shows an EF that appears to be 35% on our review. She meets criteria for CRT-D and is amenable to proceeding. She is an excellent candidate and was informed of the MADIT-CHIC trial into which she may be enrolled. She will be contacted by the study coordinator. The risks and benefits of device placement were discussed. There is a possibility that she may have a venous stenosis at the time of her procedure given her prior XRT and catheter placement as a consequence of her breast cancer.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your patient's care. Discussed and seen with Dr. Singh. 60 minutes spent with patient, > 50% on counseling and coordination of care. Please call with questions.

Dear Dr. Trey: 


I saw Neil in followup in the Shapiro Cardiovascular Center today.  He was last seen by Dr. Givertz on 04/28/14.  He is scheduled to have insertion of CRT-D next Monday 05/19/14 by Dr. Tedrow.  He is here on a semi-urgent basis for episodes of acute shortness of breath.  He tells me earlier in the week this was happening 4-5 times a day, but now has lessened a bit.  He describes a fullness and shortness of breath when he bends over to pet his dog.  He is able to lie flat with 1-2 pillows, which is stable and occasionally describes sitting up at night to catch his breath.  Other than that, he is out during the day, kayaking and making runs to Home Depot for home projects.  He tells me that he is careful with his diet and  his weight has been stable at home between 203 and 206 pounds.  His weight is actually down 3 pounds since his appointment in late April.  I discovered that he occasionally misses his morning dose of furosemide 40 mg.  He is prescribed 40 mg twice daily, but 2-3 times a week, misses it because he is too to get to a bathroom. 


Review of systems is positive for newly diagnosed diabetes.  You started him on metformin. 


He is now taking a lower dose of rosuvastatin due a slight bump in transaminase levels. 


His current medication list was reconciled today and includes carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. twice daily, colchicine 0.6 mg once daily, eplerenone 12.5 mg once daily, furosemide 40 mg p.o. twice daily,  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. once daily, and simvastatin 10 mg p.o.  at bedtime. 


On physical exam, he is a very pleasant man who is comfortable at rest.  Blood pressure 149/75 by automatic cuff, 150/80 by my check in the right arm sitting.  His weight is 206 pounds, (down 3 pounds as compared to 04/28/14).  There is no jugular venous distention at 45 degrees.  His lungs are clear.  Cardiovascular exam reveals distant heart sounds, but without murmur, rub or gallop.  His abdomen is obese but nontender.  Extremities are warm and there is no edema. 


Today's 12-lead ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 77 with left axis deviation and left bundle-branch block (QRS duration 158 milliseconds). 


Most recent laboratories 04/28/14:  Sodium 139, potassium 4.2, BUN 16, creatinine 0.75.  His cholesterol profile done on 04/28/14 shows slightly elevated triglycerides at 484.  There are no other levels to compare. 


In summary, Mr. MacKie is a 70-year-old man with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, LV ejection fraction 35% with left bundle-branch block pattern (QRS 158 milliseconds).  I would place him in New York Heart Association functional class II.  He will undergo CRT-D implantation next Monday.  He shows no signs of fluid overload on exam today.  Of note, he describes bendopnea and possibly occasional PND.  Again, on careful questioning, I discovered that he skips his morning dose of furosemide several times a week because he is too busy with errands and activities.  I advised him to take Lasix once a day and take the full dose, 80 mg in the afternoon when he is sure to take it.  He is a newly diagnosed diabetic with high triglycerides.  He would benefit from diabetic teaching and a dietitian to review his diet. 


He will return in late September to see Dr. Michael Givertz or sooner if needed. 


Thank you for allowing me to participate in care.  Please contact me for any questions or concerns at 617-732-7129. 


Sincerely,

Dear Gary: 


I had the pleasure of seeing Neil Mackie in follow-up in the Shapiro Cardiovascular Center today.  Unfortunately, his brother passed away last fall due to metastatic gastric cancer.  Mr. Mackie did not attend the funeral due to concerns about getting short of breath while flying.  He describes dyspnea when walking up hills, which seems to be worse over the last 4 days.  He also describes chest soreness when carrying groceries.  His weight is up a few pounds, and he has noted minimal ankle edema.  He denies abdominal bloating, orthopnea, or PND. 


Review of systems is positive for osteoarthritis of his left more than right knee for which he has been taking Tylenol. 


On a scale of 0-100, he marks his overall quality of life at 75.  He is not at all limited walking 1 block on level ground, or climbing a flight of stairs without stopping.  He is slightly limited doing housework, carrying groceries, hurrying or jogging.  On a scale of 0-100, with 0 being short of breath all the time and 100 being no shortness of breath at any time, he marks himself at "80 off and on." 


His current medications include carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d., eplerenone 12.5 mg p.o. daily, furosemide 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily and rosuvastatin 20 mg p.o. daily. 


On physical exam, he is an older man who is comfortable at rest.  Blood pressure 150/74 in the right arm sitting, heart rate 80 and regular, weight 209 pounds,(up 6 pounds compared with 11/2013).  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally with normal upstroke and no bruits.  There is no jugular venous distention at 45 degrees.  Lungs are clear bilaterally.  Cardiovascular exam reveals distant heart sounds without murmur or gallop.  His abdomen is obese but nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.  His extremities are lukewarm, and there is no pitting edema. 


Today's 12-lead ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 with left axis deviation and left bundle-branch block (QRS duration 144 milliseconds).  This is unchanged compared with a prior tracing. 


Laboratories from today:  Sodium 139, potassium 4.2, BUN 16, creatinine 0.97, uric acid 9.7, ALT 91, AST 56, total bilirubin 0.3, NT-proBNP 354, total cholesterol 189, triglyceride 44, HDL 42, LDL 81, TSH 0.91, hematocrit 41.0, WBC 6.54, and platelet count 190,000. 


An echocardiogram today revealed top normal LV size (EDD 55), estimated EF 35% with global hypokinesis, normal RV size and function, trace MR, trace TR and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. 


In summary, Neil Mackie is a 70-year-old man with left bundle-branch block and nonischemic cardiomyopathy who presents for follow up care.  He remains limited from a heart failure standpoint in New York Heart Association functional class II-III.  His echocardiogram continues to show at least moderate systolic dysfunction and his ECG shows left bundle-branch block.  He has been on optimal medical therapy for more than 6 months, and meets criteria for CRT-D implantation.  I have discussed this with Dr. Tedrow and she will contact Mr. Mackie to move forward.  Importantly, today's laboratories showed normal renal and thyroid function.  His transaminases are mildly elevated, however, and I have asked him to decrease his rosuvastatin to 10 mg once daily.  I will see him back in 4 months or sooner as needed. 


Thank you for letting me to participate in Mr. Mackie's care.  Please call with any questions or concerns. 


Sincerely yours,

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 This 85 year old female presents to the ER with fever and dyspnea - asked to assist in her cardiovascular management.

 Interval History:
 PCP - Dr. Patricia Gibbons 

She has history of palpitations and syncope, but prior cardiac evaluations were unremarkable. She developed LBBB sometime in the past year, although her prior ECGs were not normal and showed an intraventricular conduction defect. An echocardiogram in 4/06 showed EF of 71% with a 38 mm left atrium and 48 mm left ventricle and a borderline dilated ascending aorta of 40 mm. A Holter monitor in 6/06 showed frequent APCs with a HR range of 56 to 124 with evidence of rate induced aberrancy.A persantine thallium scan in 12/06 showed normal perfusion, but the left ventricle was dilated and hypertrophied. A follow up sestamibi test in 6/07 again showed normal perfusion, but the calculated EF was 21%. Another Holter monitor in 6/07 showed a HR ranging from 52 to 119 with no significant arrhythmias. An echocardiogram 11/07 confirmed EF of 25% with a dilated left atrium and left ventricle and mitral regurgitation due to incomplete closure of the mitral valve. Her RV systolic pressure was 47 mm. She has dyspnea of effort, and occasional palpitations. She has had "dizzy" spells, but these have correlated with sinus tachycardia and are less with elimination of her diuretic. She has fatigue and dizziness, but no angina, dyspnea or syncope. 

Over the past few days, she has had chest tightness, fevers, wheezing and malaise and presented to the ER febrile in systolic heart failure. She was diuresed and started on antibiotics. She ruled out for a myocardial infarction.

 Assessment and plan:
 This 84 year old female presented with new LBBB in the setting of minimal exertional symptoms in 2006. Her heart is dilated and hypertrophied by thallium scan. There is no evident coronary disease. Her EF is reduced of uncertain etiology. It is not hemochromatosis with a normal serum iron. It may be post-viral. Coronary disease is possible, but unlikely given the normal perfusion scan. 

There were few if any associated symptoms. Her major complaint is fatigue. She is inactive due to arthritis . She now has gained nearly ten pounds in the setting of a febrile illness. Beta blockers would be appropriate to treat hypertension and atrial ectopy in this setting, such as coreg in low doses, but she has occasional bradycardia, so I would avoid this for now. I would push lasix 40 mg bid IV and spironolactone and continuation of her ACE inhibitor. Other considerations are warfarin for her low EF before discharge. Given the ongoing deterioration, I would consider a cardiac cath on this admission once she is stable. I will follow her with you.

CC: Fatigue 


HPI: The patient is an 85 year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), HTN, carcinoid tumor, and spinal stenosis who presents with several days of wheezing, exhaustion and chest tightness.  She was in her USOH until 2d PTA, when she returned from an MRI (done for evaluation of neck pain), and felt progressively more tired.  She also admitted to chest tightness, wheezing, fevers (temp to 100 at home), shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, subjective non-shaking chills, and overall malaise.  She sleeps with two pillows, and this has not changed recently.  She denied any rhinorrhea, sore throat, conjunctivitis, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or change in urine.  She does admit to a recent sick contact with a family member on Saturday (3d PTA, and 1d prior to onset of symptoms). 


ED COURSE:  In the MGH ED, she was found to have b/l crackles, elevated JVP, and BNP of 13648.  Her Tmax of 103.5.  CXR was suggestive of b/l pulmonary edema and effusions, but could not rule out pneumonia. Flu swab was negative. Blood cultures were sent.  She was diuresed with 10mg IV furosemide, to which she diuresed 1L, received 500mg IV levofloxacin, ASA, morphine, levothyroxine and acetaminophen.  She ruled out for MI w/ 3 sets of enzymes.

Difficult to exclude a pneumonia in this background.      Follow up is suggested. 

      EKG: NSR @ 88 bpm.  LBBB pattern. Unchanged from 5/07. 


ASSESSMENT  PLAN 85F w/ cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), hypothyroidism, spinal stenosis, h/o carcoid tumor, PMR, now presenting with shortness of breath and wheezing.  Her elevated JVP, peripheral edema, suggestive CXR, and elevated BNP all point to signs of volume overload and exacerbation of her CHF.  I would not be surprised if the main contributing factor to this exacerbation is a viral illness, given her sick contacts and her fevers. CHF -          Continue diuresis with IV furosemide -          Will titrate ACE-I gingerly with intention of transitioning to once daily ACE-I dosing given her elderly status -          Recheck BNP -          Follow lytes -          Dr. Boucher to see Fever -          Likely secondary to viral respiratory illness (given wheeze) vs. UTI -          F/u urine cultures -          F/u blood cultures Wheezing -          Nebs prn Hypothyroidism -          Check TSH -          Continue levothyroxine F/E/N:  Salt restricted diet

Visit Note

Patient Name: HAJJ, HELEN A                       MRN: 3319324
Dictated Date: 02/21/2008                      Dictated By: Patricia A Gibbons, MD

Date of Visit: 02/21/2008


She is here today with her daughter Carol. She has not had any more palpitations recently. She had her Persantine thallium which was scheduled by Dr. Boucher, which was not concerning. Her surgery went well. She was not started on a beta blocker and has had no further symptoms. She has had significant increase in the pain in the right side of her neck. It starts in her right trapezius and extends up into her neck into the base of her skull. There is no radiation down her arms, no numbness or weakness of her right arm or hand. No chest wall tenderness. Of note she does have significant DJD and spinal stenosis of the lower back. 

MEDICATIONS: Levothyroxine 50 mcg every day, lisinopril 20 mg every day, aspirin 81 mg every day, Lipitor 10 mg every day, Klor-Con 10 mEq every day, Protonix 40 mg every day, iron every day, Darvocet 100/650 1/2 b.i.d.-t.i.d., ibuprofen 400 mg q.4 p.r.n. 

PHYSICAL EXAM: Blood pressure 118/72. Pulse 81. Weight 141. HEENT - NCAT. Neck: Tenderness over the right trapezius and paraspinous muscles in the neck. No bony tenderness. Decreased range of motion of the neck in all planes. Lungs CTA. Heart: RRR, no M/R/G. 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
1. Increasing right trapezius pain. Given her significant degenerative joint disease and spinal stenosis of the lower back, prior to referral to physical therapy or to the spine specialist, schedule an MRI to guide the next step of therapy. She is quite sensitive to all medications. She can try a quarter of a Flexeril, but Flexeril has made her loopy in the past. Decrease Darvocet dose to 50/325, and she may cut these in half if she prefers. Prescription for 90 with no refills as well as prescription for 270 to mail away are given today. She has an appointment next week with the doctor at the Pain Center. We will make an appointment with Dr. Mostoufi in case she needs any injections. 
2. Episode of tachycardia with left arm heaviness, lightheadedness and weakness. She underwent her surgery well. Return to Dr. Boucher with any return of these symptoms. 
3. Mild depression. Currently stable. Never started Celexa 10 mg every day. 
4. Peripheral neuropathy. Likely due to worsening spinal stenosis. Continue Darvocet now 50/325 b.i.d.-t.i.d. Unable to tolerate Neurontin or pregabalin. Continue ibuprofen as needed. Has an appointment next week with Pain Center. 
5. Hamstring tendinitis. 
6. Trochanteric bursitis. 
7. Abdominal hernia. Status post rerepair by Dr. Fernandez. 
8. Hypertension. Blood pressure in good range today. 
9. Carcinoid tumor of the distal bowel with metastases to the mesenteric lymph nodes. Continue with Dr. Fernandez and Dr. Chung. 
10. Anemia. Hematocrit back in range. Continue on iron. 
11. Bigeminy. Did not tolerate Coreg. Followup with Dr. Boucher. 
12. Constipation. 
13. Polymyalgia rheumatica. Currently not active. 
14. Hypothyroidism. 
15. Allergies. 
16. Spinal stenosis of the lumbosacral spine. MRI showed worsened area of L3 and L4. Followup with Dr. Pedlow when needed. 
17. Hyperlipidemia. 
18. History of hyponatremia and hypokalemia. Recent electrolytes normal. Recheck today prior to her next MRI. 
19. Health maintenance. Return in 2-3 months for physical exam. She will call back if her neck is not feeling better.

NAME:  Helen Hajj #331-93-24 

DATE OF VISIT:  January 10, 2008 


REASON FOR VISIT:   


Thickened endometrial stripe. 

Endometrial mass.   


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   


The patient is an 84-year-old woman who is here today with her daughter, Carol, for a follow-up appointment and visit.  Carol works here in the GI suite.  The patient was initially referred to me by Dr. Ed Huang from Gynecology for a second opinion regarding the patient's thickened endometrial stripe.  She has had a history of a carcinoid tumor treated surgically by Dr. Carlos Fernandez del Castillo.  The patient underwent a small bowel resection with a reanastomosis on April 28, 2006.  She saw Dr. Huang for a thickened endometrial stripe on imaging.  She has had several attempts at endometrial sampling including an EUA as well as an attempted hysteroscopy and DC, but secondary to her severe cervical stenosis, the endometrial cavity has not been able to be sampled.  Ms. Hajj had a follow-up pelvic MRI on November 28, 2007, which showed no significant interval changes in the 1.8 x 1 cm enhancing mass in the posterior fundus of the uterus.  The endometrial stripe is thickened measuring 12 mm.  The endometrial stripe measured 12 mm before based on an MRI from August 2007.   


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 


The patient is feeling quite well and denies any shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel or bladder function, or bleeding from the uterus. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 


She is a well-appearing 84-year-old woman in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Intact oral mucosa without evidence of dehydration or mucositis.  Abdomen is soft, nondistended, and appropriately tender with no rebound or guarding.  Extremities were nontender bilaterally.  Pelvic examination reveals normal external female genitalia with significant atrophy of the vagina and cervix.  Rectovaginal examination revealed a normal-sized uterus with no cul-de-sac nodularity or mass.   


ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 


The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a mass in the endometrial cavity as well as a 12 mm endometrial stripe, neither one of which has changed over the course of several months by serial MRI imaging.  I had a lengthy discussion today with the patient and her daughter, Carol, regarding the recommendations for either definitive surgical therapy with a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo oophorectomy through a Pfannenstiel incision or continued close surveillance.  She understands that although the imaging has not changed at all over the last several months, there is no way to definitively rule out a malignancy other than to surgically address her uterus.  The patient wishes to continue with close surveillance.  Although she expresses an understanding that we have no way to exclusively rule out a malignancy, she continues to defer definitive surgical therapy at this time.  I will make arrangements through my office for the patient to return to see me in late March or early April for a follow up examination and visit as well as a follow up pelvic MRI.  If the imaging is unchanged in the Spring, then I think it is reasonable to proceed with surveillance on a q. 6 to 12 month schedule.

CC: s/p PPM to BiV/ICD upgrade  


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS 

56M Cambodian speaking gentleman w/ PMH significant for nonobstructive HCM and SSS/PAF s/p dual chamber PPM placement in 8/08 after LMCA embolic CVA who presents to the SDU following BiV PPM w/ ICD upgrade.  


In 2/11 he required cardioversion for PAF and was started on Amio. Was unable to continue Amio 2/2 LFT abnormalities and was medically managed w/ ASA and Coumadin given CHADS-2 of 2.  


Since 7/11 has had 1-2 episodes/day of palpitations, often at night. He notices them in her chest and abdominal area, radiating to his neck which often wake him from sleep. They last only seconds but cause him to feel pre-syncopal. When he gets out of bed, they spontaneously resolve. He does have weakness at rest and w/ exertion after. No SOB or other neurological symptoms. 

Last PPM interrogation was 8/17/11. There was one HVRE on 8/8/11 at 3:41PM x6 beats @ 213 bpm, with summed EGM (either NSVT vs. SVT). Thus, HVRE detection decrease from 180 bpm to 150 bpm. Odd distribution of HR on histograms. He is AP 89.7% VP 81.4% while programmed at DDDR 50-130 bpm and MS on at 175 bpm. Device and lead function within normal limits. Now followed by Pacemaker Clinic at NSMC/Salem Hospital. 

A Holter 8/18/11 showed primary rhythm was a paced rhythm. Minimum HR 49 bpm with maximum HR 130 bpm, mean 73 bpm. There were 3 hrs 47 min of bradycardia which occurred while pt was sleeping. There were 2 hrs and 52 minutes of tachycardia. The fastest episode occurred at 12:53 pm (pt states he was walking at this time and asymptomatic). VE consisted of 61 beats of which 56 were single PVCs, 1 was an interpolated PVC and 4 were single VEs. SVE consisted of 2652 beats of which 43 were in 3 runs, 56 were atrial couplets. There were 2438 PACs, 46 were in bigeminy, 69 were in trigeminy. The longest supraventricular run (which was actually 100% VP) occurred at 2:35 am consisting of 31 beats with a maximum HR of 111.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 Upgrade of dual-chamber pacemaker to dual-chamber ICD 

 Interval History:
 Mr. Lee Tum is a 56M seen in consultation at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic on 10/07/2011. He has a history of nonobstructive HCM and SSS/PAF who underwent dual chamber pacemaker implant 8/19/2008 following left MCA embolic CVA. His most recent PAF episode was 2/2011 for which he required cardioversion at MGH. He was unable to continue on amiodarone d/t elevated LFTs and is medically managed on Coumadin and aspirin with a CHADS2 score of 2 (CVA). 

Since July 2011, he has been reporting 1-2 episodes a day (most often in middle of night) he feels palpitations in his chest and abdominal area that radiates to his neck that awaken and weaken him, lasting only seconds but feel like he is going to pass out. He gets up to urinate and they always self-resolve. He then experiences an overall weakness. Events occur both at rest and with exertion. Denies any enhanced shortness of breath, blurring of vision, or focal deficits. 

His Echocardiogram from 10/2010 revealed LVID 44, IVS 22, PWT 8, EF 57% with LA 54 mm. There was no resting or provokable LVOT gradient. Flow reversal in the hepatic veins detected by Doppler c/w severe TR or non-compliant right ventricle, RVSP 41mmHg, +RVH, small circumferential pericardial effusion most prominent at the inferoposterior territories at the base, no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. 

His most recent pacemaker interrogation was done urgently at MGH for further evaluated of his palpitations and presyncope on 8/17/11. There was one HVRE on 8/8/11 at 3:41PM x6 beats @ 213 bpm, with summed EGM (either NSVT vs. SVT). Thus, HVRE detection decrease from 180 bpm to 150 bpm. Odd distribution of HR on histograms. He is AP 89.7% VP 81.4% while programmed at DDDR 50-130 bpm and MS on at 175 bpm. Device and lead function within normal limits. Pt typically followed by Pacemaker Clinic at NSMC/Salem Hospital. 

A Holter 8/18/11 showed primary rhythm was a paced rhythm. Minimum HR 49 bpm with maximum HR 130 bpm, mean 73 bpm. There were 3 hrs 47 min of bradycardia which occurred while pt was sleeping. There were 2 hrs and 52 minutes of tachycardia. The fastest episode occurred at 12:53 pm (pt states he was walking at this time and asymptomatic). VE consisted of 61 beats of which 56 were single PVCs, 1 was an interpolated PVC and 4 were single VEs. SVE consisted of 2652 beats of which 43 were in 3 runs, 56 were atrial couplets. There were 2438 PACs, 46 were in bigeminy, 69 were in trigeminy. The longest supraventricular run (which was actually 100% VP) occurred at 2:35 am consisting of 31 beats with a maximum HR of 111.

 Assessment and plan:
 Mr. Tum is a 56 year old gentleman with history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who suffered embolic lef MCA CVA 8/2008 with resolved right hemiparesis in the setting of newly detected SSS/PAF followed by right-sided dual chamber pacemaker implant 8/19/2008. He has been followed by Dr. Fifer for his HCM and Dr. Kemper at Salem Hospital along with his Pacemaker Clinic visits. 

We reviewed his recent complaints of presyncope and palpitations as well as his Holter and pacemaker interrogation from 8/2011. Given his history of HCM with increased IVS of 22 mm as of 10/2010 and evidence of NSVT (albeit 6 beats) @ 100 beats per minute on pacemaker interrogation, we have recommended upgrading his dual chamber pacemaker to dual chamber ICD for primary prevention of SCA. Cambodian interpreter Chantha Long from MGH Interpreter Services was present throughout our clinic visit on 10/07/2011. 

Most of the visit discussed the upgrade procedure, recovery from and follow up care. He had his questions answered and agreed to proceed; consent has been signed. He will not stop Coumadin, due to history of embolic CVA from PAF, but will keep his INR as close to 2.0 as possible within 2 days prior to his procedure. His next INR is due 10/13/11 and will get preprocedure labs done at that time. He should also have his INR checked 2 days prior to his upgrade to ICD procedure. He will not need to hold any medications prior to. He will have right venogram to assess for patency, and given his small frame size, will try and keep his ICD system on the right if possible. In no vein patency, then remove right sided pacemaker and place left sided ICD with new RV defib lead from left with tunnel of RV pace lead over to left. In order to suppress both PAF and NSVT events, we resumed Toprol XL 25mg daily on 10/07/2011. He will be return for one follow up with us and our ICD Clinic for his first follow up in 4-6 weeks after implant, to assess wound and arrhythmia burden. He was then encouraged to continue his local ICD follow up care at NSMC/Salem Hospital.

The patient was seen by Dr. Mela who confirmed the history of present illness, and reviewed the ROS, and past/family/social history. I also personally performed the comprehensive cardiac exam detailed above including examination of the jugular veins, auscultation of the lungs, palpation and auscultation of the heart. In addition, I examined the carotid arteries, the abdomen for masses and bruits, the femoral arteries, distal pulses, and extremities for peripheral edema, clubbing and cyanosis. I reviewed all diagnostic test reports, and assisted in determining the assessment and plan.

 Reason for visit:
 Upgrade of dual-chamber pacemaker to dual-chamber ICD 

 Interval History:
 Mr. Lee Tum is a 56M seen in consultation at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic on 10/07/2011. He has a history of nonobstructive HCM and SSS/PAF who underwent dual chamber pacemaker implant 8/19/2008 following left MCA embolic CVA. His most recent PAF episode was 2/2011 for which he required cardioversion at MGH. He was unable to continue on amiodarone d/t elevated LFTs and is medically managed on Coumadin and aspirin with a CHADS2 score of 2 (CVA). 

Since July 2011, he has been reporting 1-2 episodes a day (most often in middle of night) he feels palpitations in his chest and abdominal area that radiates to his neck that awaken and weaken him, lasting only seconds but feel like he is going to pass out. He gets up to urinate and they always self-resolve. He then experiences an overall weakness. Events occur both at rest and with exertion. Denies any enhanced shortness of breath, blurring of vision, or focal deficits. 

His Echocardiogram from 10/2010 revealed LVID 44, IVS 22, PWT 8, EF 57% with LA 54 mm. There was no resting or provokable LVOT gradient. Flow reversal in the hepatic veins detected by Doppler c/w severe TR or non-compliant right ventricle, RVSP 41mmHg, +RVH, small circumferential pericardial effusion most prominent at the inferoposterior territories at the base, no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. 

His most recent pacemaker interrogation was done urgently at MGH for further evaluated of his palpitations and presyncope on 8/17/11. There was one HVRE on 8/8/11 at 3:41PM x6 beats @ 213 bpm, with summed EGM (either NSVT vs. SVT). Thus, HVRE detection decrease from 180 bpm to 150 bpm. Odd distribution of HR on histograms. He is AP 89.7% VP 81.4% while programmed at DDDR 50-130 bpm and MS on at 175 bpm. Device and lead function within normal limits. Pt typically followed by Pacemaker Clinic at NSMC/Salem Hospital. 

A Holter 8/18/11 showed primary rhythm was a paced rhythm. Minimum HR 49 bpm with maximum HR 130 bpm, mean 73 bpm. There were 3 hrs 47 min of bradycardia which occurred while pt was sleeping. There were 2 hrs and 52 minutes of tachycardia. The fastest episode occurred at 12:53 pm (pt states he was walking at this time and asymptomatic). VE consisted of 61 beats of which 56 were single PVCs, 1 was an interpolated PVC and 4 were single VEs. SVE consisted of 2652 beats of which 43 were in 3 runs, 56 were atrial couplets. There were 2438 PACs, 46 were in bigeminy, 69 were in trigeminy. The longest supraventricular run (which was actually 100% VP) occurred at 2:35 am consisting of 31 beats with a maximum HR of 111.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Tum returns for further evaluation of his right shoulder pain.  He reports that he still needs to use the Lidoderm patch every second to third day because of pain in the shoulder, which makes it difficult for him to sleep at night.  His shoulder is otherwise doing pretty well.  He is status post an embolic stroke with residual mild right hemiparesis. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam today, he has full and pain free forward flexion of the shoulder, abduction, internal and external rotation.   


IMPRESSION:  He nonetheless reports an aching pain at times in the shoulder, which is relieved with the Lidoderm patch.  A prescription for further Lidoderm patches is given to him today and a request for prior authorization will be filled out for his Mass Health account.  He will return to see me if needed again for his shoulder pain or other stroke related problem of note.

Today, we reviewed his recent complaints of presyncope and palpitations as well as his Holter and pacemaker interrogation from 8/2011. Given his history of HCM with increased IVS of 22 mm as of 10/2010 and evidence of NSVT (albeit 6 beats) @ 100 beats per minute on pacemaker interrogation, we have recommended upgrading his dual chamber pacemaker to dual chamber ICD for primary prevention of SCA. Cambodian interpreter Chantha Long from MGH Interpreter Services was present throughout our visit today. 

Most of the visit discussed the upgrade procedure, recovery from and follow up care. He had his questions answered and agreed to proceed; consent has been signed. He will not stop Coumadin, due to history of embolic CVA from PAF, but will keep his INR as close to 2.0 as possible within 2 days prior to his procedure. His next INR is due 10/13/11 and will get preprocedure labs done at that time. He should also have his INR checked 2 days prior to his upgrade to ICD procedure. He will not need to hold any medications prior to. He will have right venogram to assess for patency, and given his small frame size, will try and keep his ICD system on the right if possible. In no vein patency, then remove right sided pacemaker and place left sided ICD with new RV defib lead from left with tunnel of RV pace lead over to left. In order to suppress both PAF and NSVT events, we resumed Toprol XL 25mg daily today. 

It was a pleasure seeing Mr. Tum in the MGH Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic today. He will be return for one follow up with us and our ICD Clinic for his first follow up in 4-6 weeks after implant, to assess wound and arrhythmia burden. He was then encouraged to continue his local ICD follow up care at NSMC/Salem Hospital. He was encouraged to contact us if his clinical status changes in the meantime. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us. 

Sincerely, 

Vanessa Preble, NP 

The patient was seen by Dr. Mela who confirmed the history of present illness, and reviewed the ROS, and past/family/social history. I also personally performed the comprehensive cardiac exam detailed above including examination of the jugular veins, auscultation of the lungs, palpation and auscultation of the heart. In addition, I examined the carotid arteries, the abdomen for masses and bruits, the femoral arteries, distal pulses, and extremities for peripheral edema, clubbing and cyanosis. I reviewed all diagnostic test reports, and assisted in determining the assessment and plan.

HPI 

Mr. Grasso is an 84 year-old man with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy EF 25%, CAD, complete heart block s/p PPM, afib, HTN, severe MR, CRI, and recently diagnosed prostate cancer. 


Between 2006 and 2007 Mr. Grasso was hospitalized several times for CHF. Lasix dose was increased, and eventually his symptoms improved.  However, since December 2009, he has had progressive worsening in dyspnea.  He considers himself fairly active, but becomes short of breath with climbing a flight of stairs or performing daily activities. Other symptoms have included diminished appetite (though his weight has been stable at 140 pounds) and anxiety.  He denies chest pain, palpitations, PND, orthopnea, dizziness, lightheadedness, and syncope.  He reports adherence to his recommended diet. 


Because of progressive symptoms, he is being admitted for placement of a CRT-ICD device.

REPORT     Radionuclide bone scan:

     COMPARISON: Abdomen/pelvis CT 5/7/10

     TECHNIQUE:  
     719 MBq technetium 99m MDP was injected.  Scans were performed more 
     than two hours later.  Whole body images were acquired and 
     appropriate spot views were obtained based upon review of the whole 
     body images.

     FINDINGS:  
     There is a focus of increased radiotracer uptake in the lateral right 
     8th rib, corresponding to a well-defined sclerotic lesion on today's 
     CT.  The findings are consistent with a fracture or a bony 
     metastasis.  There is also increased uptake along the left sacroiliac 
     joint, corresponding to degenerative changes seen on the abdominal 
     pelvic CT, though early metastasis cannot be excluded.  Increased 
     uptake involving the shoulders, knees, and ankles is likely 
     degenerative.

     
     IMPRESSION: 
     1.  Focus of increased uptake in the right lateral eighth rib, 
     corresponding to a sclerotic lesion on CT.  Findings are consistent 
     with a fracture or bony metastasis.
     2.  Increased uptake along the left sacroiliac joint may reflect 
     degenerative disease, though early metastasis cannot be excluded.

Assessment and Plan 

Gleason 4+5 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. PSA 84. Clinical stage T3. Together with Dr. Lee from medical oncology and Dr. Efstathiou from radiation oncology, we have discussed all the treatment options. He will initiate hormonal therapy with Dr. Lee and then will repeat a bone scan in 4 months. If there is no evidence that he has metastatic disease, he will undergo EBRT for local treatment. I am happy to be involved if needed in the future.

PATIENT NAME:  GRASSO, PETER;    MRN:  0163778 



RADIATION ONCOLOGY CONSULTATION NOTE 


DATE OF CONSULTATION:  05/14/2010 


REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Adam S. Feldman, M.D. 


DIAGNOSIS:  High-risk locally advanced, likely metastatic, prostate cancer. 


IDENTIFICATION:  Mr. Peter Grasso is an 84-year-old gentleman who is seen in consultation today in the GU Oncology Multidisciplinary Clinic at the request of Dr. Feldman for recommendations in the management of his newly diagnosed high-risk locally advanced prostate cancer. 


NARRATIVE:  The patients PSA was drawn on March 1, 2010, which was significantly elevated at 84.16.  Digital rectal examination revealed significant abnormality.  The patient was seen by Dr. Jeffrey Talbot of Urology in Melrose and was then referred to Dr. Feldman for further evaluation.  Physical examination confirmed a firm prostate throughout with extension of the firmness towards the SV on the right.   


Prostate biopsy was performed on April 30, 2010.  Prostate volume was measured at 55 cc.  Pathology revealed adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+5=9/10 involving 90% of 2 cores from the right apex and 90% of 2 cores from the right base with perineural invasion and involvement of adipose tissue consistent with extraprostatic extension.  In addition, there was Gleason score 3+5=8/10 involving 90% of 2 cores from the left apex.  There was also Gleason score 4+3=7/10 involving 90% of 2 cores from the right mid gland and Gleason score 3+4=7/10 involving 100% of 2 cores in the left mid gland and 90% of 2 cores from the left base.  In total, all 12 cores were involved. 


Staging CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an enlarged prostate without any significantly enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen or pelvis or bony lesions to suggest metastatic disease.  Cardiomegaly was noted with a right pleural effusion.  Same day bone scan on May 7, 2010, revealed a focus of increased uptake in the right lateral eighth rib corresponding to sclerotic lesion on CT. Findings are consistent with a fracture or bony metastasis.  There is also increased uptake along the left sacroiliac joint, which may reflect degenerative disease, though early metastasis could not be excluded. 


The patient is referred to our clinic for further recommendations in his management.  PSA drawn today was further significantly elevated at 102.6. 


The patient has described significant urinary symptoms with frequency, intermittency, and urgency.  AUA symptom score 23/35.  Quality of life score 3/6.  Nocturia x4.  No hematuria.  No significant GI symptoms.  He does have underlying erectile dysfunction.  He denies any specific pain attributable to the areas that are noted on bone scan, namely, he does not have any rib pain.  He does note that he used to get it in fights when he was younger, but does not recall any particular incidents involving rib fracture. 


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No unexplained weight loss.  No fevers, chills, or night sweats.  No headaches, dizziness, vertigo, changes in vision, or changes in hearing.  No sore throat, oral ulcers, or difficulty swallowing.  No chest pain, palpitations, cough, or hemoptysis.  He does describe shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion after one block and with climbing stairs.  No abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, melena, or rectal bleeding.  No dysuria.  No upper or lower extremity weakness or paresthesias.  No new bony aches or pains.  All other systems are unremarkable. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 29%, coronary artery disease status post MI in 1993 treated medically, complete heart block status post dual chamber pacemaker in 1991 with generator change in 1999 in 2005 related to recall, Guidant dual-chamber pacemaker dependent, congestive heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic renal insufficiency, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, frequent ventricular ectopy, atrial fibrillation, severe mitral regurgitation, and tonsillectomy as a child.  Plan is for the patient to get a defibrillator in the near future. 


MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg, digoxin 0.125 mg, Imdur 30 mg, Lasix 40 mg q.a.m./20 mg q.p.m., lisinopril 2.5 mg q.d., multivitamin 1 tablet q.d., simvastatin 5 mg q.a.m., Toprol-XL 25 mg b.i.d., and warfarin q.h.s. 


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 


SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mr. Grasso lives with his wife in Saugus, Massachusetts.  His granddaughter lives downstairs.  He is accompanied today by his wife and daughter and son-in-law.  Quit cigarettes 30 years ago.  No alcohol.  Retired meat cutter.  His family is very involved and supportive in his care. 


FAMILY HISTORY:  No known family history of GU malignancies. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, a well-developed, pleasant, elderly gentleman, who appears his stated age, in no acute distress.  ECOG performance status is 1.  HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  PERRL.  EOMI.  No scleral icterus.  No conjunctival injection.  Moist mucous membranes.  Oropharynx is clear.  He is somewhat hard of hearing.  Cardiovascular:  Not examined.  Lungs:  Clear.  Normal respirations.  Abdomen:  Benign.  GU/Rectal:  Deferred today.  Per Dr. Feldmans recent examination, the prostate is diffusely firm with extension of firmness towards the seminal vesicle on the right.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

IMPRESSION:  84-year-old gentleman with clinical T3, Gleason score 9, PSA 102 prostatic adenocarcinoma, involving 12/12 cores and bone scan concerning for possible right lateral eighth rib metastasis. 


RECOMMENDATIONS:  The patient was seen along with Dr. Feldman from Urology and Dr. Lee from Medical Oncology.  We discussed with Mr. Grasso and his family, the diagnosis, natural history, and prognosis of high-risk locally advanced, and possibly metastatic, prostate cancer.  We indicated that if, indeed, his disease is metastatic to bone that the treatment of choice would be longer-term androgen deprivation therapy.  We explained that he is not a candidate for local surgical therapy and that if possible we would also try to avoid local external beam radiation therapy, especially if his disease is metastatic and given his advanced age and significant comorbidities.  We have agreed that he will initiate a course of hormonal therapy, and we will repeat his bone scan in approximately 4 months time.  If the focus of increased uptake in the right rib decreases, this would be suggestive of metastatic disease, and he would continue on prolonged hormonal therapy.  If, however, the focus is stable, some consideration may be given to a course of local external beam radiation therapy to the prostate with the intention of local control of disease (given that we believe that he does harbor at the very least micrometastatic disease given his Gleason score exam and significantly elevated PSA).  We discussed the rationale of our recommendations as well as the risks and benefits associated with androgen deprivation therapy.  Mr. Grasso and his family had their questions answered in detail.  He wishes to proceed with hormonal therapy and will initiate Lupron today under the care of Dr. Lee.  We will plan to follow up with the patient in approximately 4 months to assess his status and repeat his bone scan and will again address any potential role for local therapy at that time.  He knows to call me at any time with further questions or concerns. 


Total visit time was 60 minutes of which greater than 50% was spent in counseling and coordination of care.

New Patient Note 


Patient: Grasso, Peter 

MGH MRN: 0163778 


Oncology history / treatment summary:  

3/1/10: screening PSA 84.16. Seen by Dr. Jeffrey Talbot of Melrose urology. Referred to Dr. Feldman, who palpated a firm gland including the R SV. 

5/4/10: TRUS/bx: 55cc gland. Gleason 4+5 adenoca in 4/6 cores on R (90% of tissue), Gleason 3+5 in 2/6 cores on L, Gleason 4+3 in 2/6 cores on R, Gleason 3+4 in 4/6 cores on L. 

5/7/10: CT abd/pelvis: (-) LAN. Cardiomegaly and R pleural effusion noted. 

5/7/10: bone scan: (+) focus of increased uptake in R lateral 8th rib, corresponding to sclerotic lesion on CT (fx vs met); (+) increased uptake in L SI jt (degenerative disease vs early met). 

5/14/10: initial visit to MGH GU multidisciplinary clinic, referred by Dr. Feldman. AUA 23/35, QOL 3/6. Nocturia x4. Voiding is better since starting Flomax. 


History of present illness: 

84yo man w/ significant cardiac problems (CAD s/p MI, CHB requiring pacemaker, arrythmias requiring placement of AICD scheduled for 5/24/2010) who had a screening PSA measured as 84.16. He originally saw Dr. Jeffrey Talbott of urology in Melrose, who then referred him to Dr. Feldman of MGH urology. DRE revealed a diffusely firm gland and possible involvement of the R SV. Prostate bx on 5/4/10 revealed a 55cc gland, in which all cores were involved with adenocarcinoma, including Gleason 4+5, 3+5, 4+3, and 3+4. Staging scans were remarkable for a focus of uptake in the bone scan in the R lateral 8th rib and L SI joint, although degenerative changes could account for these findings. He was referred to this clinic for discussion of mgmt options. He presents w/ his wife, daughter, and son-in-law today. Other ROS below.

Assessment and recommendations: 

84yo man w/ severe cardiac comorbidities (CAD, EF 25%, AFib, pacemaker, need for AICD), and 4/2010 diagnosis of Gleason 4+5 adenoca. His disease is high-risk based on the Gleason sum of 9, PSA 84, and clinical stage T3b. His staging scans suggest uptake at the L SI joint, but no definitive metastases. The natural history, treatment options, and prognosis were discussed today along w/ Dr. Feldman of urology and Dr. Efstathiou of radiation oncology. If indeed his disease is localized, his advanced age and signficant cardiac problems make surgery less desirable than less-invasive modes of therapy. We then focused our discussion on radiation therapy. Dr. Efstathiou discussed the logistics of external beam radiation therapy. For his high-risk disease, he will certainly need androgen deprivation therapy, to commence before EBRT, and to last for 3 years.  


Importantly, Mr. Grasso's disease is extremely high-risk with some bone scan findings that could represent distant metastasis already. In this setting we would hope to avoid therapies that will not be beneficial to him, and we proposed that we proceed with hormone therapy, then re-assess the bone scan after approximately 3-4 months to determine whether his disease appears to be localized and if so, then proceed w/ EBRT. He and his family agreed with this course. We agreed to a one month dose of Lupron today, and another visit after one month to assess side effects. At that time, we would likely give a 3 month injection, and schedule a bone scan prior to his 3rd visit. 


The standard approach to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is with Lupron. We discussed side effects of ADT in detail, including but not limited to hot flashes, weight gain, loss of lean muscle mass, fatigue, anemia, bone loss, impotence, loss of libido, potential effects on insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular illness. I emphasized that exercise and nutrition will be critical for maintaining lean muscle mass and avoiding abundant weight gain. Further, weight-bearing exercise was strongly recommended to prevent early osteoporosis, as well as supplementation with calcium and vitamin D. A prescription for Ca/Vit will be provided. Given his age and low BMI, he already is a high fracture risk prior to starting ADT, and at some point we will need to consider primary fracture prevention with a bisphosphonate.  


I also described the flare phenomenon of using GnRH agonists, which during the first few weeks of Lupron therapy can be accompanied by a transient rise in testosterone. For this, anti-androgen therapy with daily oral bicalutamide has been proven effective, and a prescription will be given today for a 4 week course, which he will start today. Information sheets on both leuprolide and bicalutamide were provided today. 


Mr. Grasso agreed to this plan. All questions were answered. He was given our contact information should other questions or issues arise. 


Plan: 

- Lupron 7.5 mg IM x1 today. 

- start bicalutamide 50mg qd x30d today. Prescription given. 

- encouraged exercise (limited by cardiac problems), Ca/Vit D. 

- consider primary fracture prevention in the future if he tolerates ADT. 

- repeat bone scan in approx 4 mos for consideration of EBRT (if the lesion on prior bone scan diminishes in response to ADT). 

- RTC 1 month.

RE: Evaluation for upgrade to CRT- ICD device

Dear Dr. Shin: Thank you for referring Mr. Grasso to the Cardiac Arrhythmia Services for evaluation for upgrade to CRT-ICD device

 Dr. Milan and I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Peter Grasso today in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Services clinic for evaluation for upgrade to CRT-ICD device. As you know, he is an 84 year-old gentleman with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 25%, his history includes an MI in 1993 and has been medically treated since that time. Other past medical history includes congestive heart failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, and complete heart block status post dual chamber pacemaker at BI in 1991 with generator change in 1999 and 2005 due to a recall. Between 2006 and 2007 Mr. Grasso was hospitalized several times for congestive heart failure. At that time, lasix was increased and his HF symptoms improved. 

He returns today because he has had progressive worsening in shortness of breath since December 2009. He considers himself fairly active, but notes becoming short of breath with climbing a flight of stairs or performing daily activities. He also notes of decrease in appetite and feeling anxious and describe it as butterflies. His weight has been stable at 140 pounds. Recent TTE shows EF is 25%. EKG shows underlying rhythm is atrial fibrillation. V-paced at 70 bpm. He is maintained on lasix, aspirin, metoprolol, digoxin, isosorbide, lisinopril, and Coumadin. He denies symptoms of CP, palpitations, PND, orthopnea, dizziness, presyncope, and syncope. 

The patient denies dietary indiscretions. He reports adhering to his diet. He states that his weight has been stable. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or dyspnea on exertion.

 Past medical history:
 1. Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy EF 29%

 Other Data:
 CXR 04.29.10: Abnormal findings - Nodular opacity measuring approximately 1.3 cm projecting over the right heart on the frontal examination, not clearly identified on previous examinations. CT of the chest is recommended for evaluation. 
Small new bilateral pleural effusions. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Cardiac pacemaker, unchanged. 

TTE 03/2010: EF 25%. 

TTE 07.27.07 : Conclusions: Severe MR directed eccentrically in posterior/lateral direction. LA dilated 40 mm. Trace AI. LV cavity size is dilated with severely impaired systolic function. LV is diffusely hypokinetic with regional wall variation. The basal and mid anterolateral walls are best preserved. Probable LV scar noted in the inferior wall. EF 29%. Mild TI. Trace PI. RVSP 55 mmHg. Apical and inferior wall segmental RV dysfunction. Overall RV systolic function is within normal limits. 


 Impression:
 Mr. Grasso is an 84-year-old gentleman with a history of CAD, status post an MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and complete heart block status post dual chamber PPM 1991 with generator replacement 1999 and 2005. 


 Assessment and plan:
 Mr. Grasso is an 84 year-old gentleman with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and history of congestive heart failure, LVEF 25%, with NYHA class III now dyspneic with minimal exertion on optimal HF medications, who appears to meet SCD-HeFT criteria for ICD for the prevention of SCD, and he may also benefit from CRT-D for the treatment of heart failure. 

We reviewed the physiology of the hearts normal electrical conduction, cardiac resynchronization, and the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death with Mr. Grasso and family. Given his history we recommend ICD for primary prevention of SCD and cardiac resynchronization with upgrade of his PPM device to CRT-D (addition of LV lead) for treatment of heart failure. We discussed the details of the procedure for implantation of CRT-ICD, its success, and potential complication associated with the procedure including: infection, bleeding, hematoma, cardiac perforation, pneumothorax, MI, stroke, and death. We also informed him that there is a potential need for surgical placement of LV lead; if placement is unsuccessful during implantation of CRT-ICD device. He understands and wishes to proceed with an upgrade to CRT-ICD device for primary prevention of SCD and treatment of heart failure. 

He will be admitted to MGH EP lab on Monday, May 24, 2010 for upgrade to CRT-ICD device. He is pacemaker dependent and will require temporary pacing. No DFTs. He was instructed to stop Coumadin 5 days prior to the procedure. He will have preliminary blood work, UA, and CXR done. 

It was a pleasure seeing Mr. Grasso today in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Services clinic.

History of Present Illness 

Mr. Grasso is sent to me in consultation for an elevated PSA. He is a very pleasant 84-year-old man who comes with his daughter and son-in-law to the visit. He had a PSA measured by his primary care doctor which was reportedly 84.  

He was referred to Dr. Talbott, a local urologist, who recommended a prostate biopsy after his digital rectal exam revealed a very firm concerning prostate.  They are here in search of a second opinion.

cc: transfer from CT Surgical ICU s/p VT ablation 


HPI: 

65 yo M with h/o niCMP 2/2 longstanding AI (EF 23%), htn, LBBB, endocarditis w/AV/MV repair in 1998, recurrent VT s/p ICD and ablation x2 (both in 1/2014), hypothyroidism, anxiety, admitted to CCU s/p attempted VT ablation on 2/5.  


The patient has had longstanding niCMP thought 2/2 an episode of endocarditis in his 30s, which caused severe AI.  He then underwent AVR and MV repair in 1998, at which point ICD was placed (per patient, for primary prevention) as well.  He reports having no arrhythmia issues and no ICD firings until January of 2014.  He first experienced symptomatic VT in early January, for which he underwent VT ablation at Yale New Haven Hospital on 1/10/14.  He then reports further issues with VT, for which he underwent a repeat ablation on 1/28/14, also at YNHH.  Then two days ago, on 2/2/14, he had the acute onset sensation of racing heart rate, for which he presented to the Griffin Hospital ED in CT.  He did not syncopize or feel pre-syncopal, but was aware of fast heart rate.  Reportedly, on arrival to Griffin he was found to be in slow monomorphic VT (vs that was shown on ICD interrogation--unclear from the records that accompany the patient).  VS initially at Griffin were reportedly remarkable for stable BP and temp of 100.4.  He was then transferred from Griffin to YNHH. 


OSH Course (Yale-New Haven Hospital, 2/2-2/4/14):  

Per discharge summary and MD expect note: 2/2/14 presented with sensation of fast heartbeat, no ICD shocks.  Device interrogation revealed monomorphic VT.  K and Mg "on the lower side" and were repleted.  Amiodarone was increased to 200 mg qday (however this is not c/w patient's report that his home dose is 200 mg alternating with 400 mg daily).  Home Coreg was continued.  Troponin (not specified T or I) was stable but elevated (0.63 and 0.57) with flat CK/MB.  EP consult saw the patient.  Per DC summary, had 5 beats VT on tele while at YNHH.  However, pt arrives on lidocaine gtt (not mentioned in DC summary) and per review of EKGs from YNHH, he has multiple EKGs (most recent from 3 am on 2/4/14) showing VT in the 107-120 BPM rate range, with RBBB morphology.  Per nursing pass off, lido bolus/gtt was started at 11 am on 2/4/14.  Was given 40 mg IV Lasix x1 and diuresed > 1L while at YNHH.  BNP 1290.  No fevers were noted at Yale.  Of note, while there he also reported constipation with mild blood streaking around hard stools (in s/o known hemorrhoids).  VS on DC: 98.2 94 114/74 27 95% 2L NC.  HD stable throughout his course.  Xferred to BWH for evaluation for a third VT ablation by Dr. Stevenson. 


The patient was admitted to the B-team on 2/4 with plans for EP ablation the following morning.  At that time he arrived feeling well, without chest pain, cough, abdominal pain, or N/V.  He walked multiple miles multiple times a day with his wife up until last month, and since then has cut down his exercise considerably due to anxiety about having VT (he has had no increase in symptoms with exertion, however).  He has had no recent medication changes.  He has been on amiodarone for many decades, per his report.  He cannot recall when his last ICD shock was, though does know that he has had shocks in he past month, and is extremely nervous about being shocked again.  His arrhythmia episodes are accompanied by a sensation of anxiety and fast heart rate, but not by chest pain or syncope/lightheadedness. 


ICU Course (2/7-2/10/14): 

On 2/5 the patient underwent attempted VT ablation at BWH.  Able to induce VT from the left ventricle base but was not amenable to ablation as it was likely intramural scar that could not be approached from within the heart.  Alcohol ablation was thus performed into an OM feeding the area. Initially appeared successful but then recurrent VT at that focus was induced. IABP was placed intraprocedurally and epinephrine administered for augmented BP during episodes of VT but was removed in the EP lab.  Extubated in EP lab.  Both femorals were accessed, Perclose devices were used on bilateral femoral arteries. R venous sheath retained at time of transfer. Off pressors at the time of arrival to the CCU.  


Overnight after the procedure the patient had three periods of intermittent VT, each with HRs in the 110s and each lasting 30-60 seconds. The patient was asymptomatic during these episodes and each resolved spontaneously. The patient's SBP transiently dropped to the 90s during one of the episodes but in general his SBPs remained in the 110s or greater. The next morning, however, the patient again recurred into VT with a HR of 110. This episode was more sustained. The patient's BP was stable so a lidocaine bolus was given and he was started on a lidocaine drip at 1mg/min. After approximately 20 minutes the patient became lightheaded so the patient was lightly sedated and one shock was delivered which converted the patient out of VT into sinus rhythm. EP recommended starting quinidine sulfate 200mg q8H and a first dose was given shortly thereafter. Lidocaine gtt turned off later that evening. On quinidine, the patient has had no further episodes of VT. EP changed ICD device setting to 110 threshold for ATP. Venous sheath was pulled. 


Surgical ICU (2/10-present) 

Per fellow verbal passoff. On ~2/11/14, he underwent left ventricular mapping, cryomaze ablation, and epicardial lead placement through a small left thoracotomy. He was initially VT free, though in the past 2 days has had intermittent runs of 3-5 minutes of hemodynamically stable VT. EP is following and does not wish to make changes at this point given HD stability; however, will consider AICD in the future depending on pending blood cultures. Did spike on 2/15, with cultures drawn yesterday with no growth and cultures today pending. The option of VAD/transplant for recurrent VT was discussed with the patient and his family, but he declined at this time.

Studies: 


ECHO:
Date:  02/05/2014 08:39  


Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is mild to moderately dilated. There is 
left ventricular hypertrophy with relative anteroseptal thinning. The 
visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is severely reduced at 
20-25%. There is global hypokinesis with regional variation, affecting the 
basal anterior and inferior septum and apex severely. Abnormal (paradoxical) 
motion is consistent with post-operative status and bundle branch block. No 
obvious left ventricular thrombus is detected.

Right Ventricle: The right ventricular size is normal. Global RV systolic 
function is low normal. A pacemaker or AICD wires are seen in the right 
heart.
Left Atrium: Normal left atrial size.
Right Atrium: The right atrium is normal in size.
Aortic Valve: A mechanical aortic prosthesis appears well-seated with normal 
function. The peak antegrade aortic valve velocity is 2.6 m/s. The peak 
instantaneous aortic valve gradient is 27 mmHg. The mean aortic valve 
gradient is 16 mmHg (averaged over multiple beats). There is no significant 
aortic regurgitation.
Mitral Valve: The mitral valve is status post repair with an annuloplasty 
ring. Trace mitral regurgitation is present.
Tricuspid Valve: The tricuspid valve is structurally normal. Trace tricuspid 
valve regurgitation is present. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be accurately estimated.
Pulmonic Valve: Structurally normal pulmonic valve. There is no pulmonary 
valve regurgitation.
Aorta: The aortic root size is borderline dilated, measuring 4.0 cm at the 
sinuses.
Pulmonary Artery: The pulmonary artery appears normal in size.
Venous: The inferior vena cava was not well seen.
Pericardium/Pleura: There is a pericardial fat pad. 

Comparison /Summary: No prior BWH studies or reports for comparison.

1/7/14 TTE: Severely increased LV size, normal wall thickness, severe global systolic dysfunction, EF 13%, normal RV size, moderately increased systolic function, mechanical prosthetic aortic valve, bileaflet tilting disk type, well seated, no significant stenosis or regurg. 


2/3/14 TTE: Severely increased LV size with normal wall thickness.  Severe global HK.  Marked septal dyssynergy.  EF 23%.  Normal RV size with mildly decreased systolic function.  Mechanical prosthetic aortic valve, well seated, no leak.  No significant effusion.  No significant change from 1/7/14. 


EKGs on Admission to CCU: Flipping between (1) NSR in the 90s with 1st degree AV block, wide LBBB pattern and (2) VT in the 90s with wide QRS, with V1 upright 


Assessment/Plan: 

65 yo M with h/o niCMP (EF 23%), HTN, LBBB, AVR/MV repair in 1998, recurrent VT s/p ICD and ablation x2, hypothyroidism, anxiety, p/w recurrent VT now s/p alcohol ablation to OM on 2/5 and epicardial lead placement/cryomaze ablation by Dr. Couper on 2/11 who is transferred to the B team with recurrent VT.  


#CVr: recurrent VT 

Has had an incredibly complicated course, now s/p alcohol ablation on 2/5, cryomaze ablation on 2/11 by Dr. Couper, and now with 2-3 episodes of 3-5 minute runs of hemodynamically stable VT despite treatment with mexilitine and quinidine. Fortunately, EP has been consulted and there is hope the VT will not become hemodynamically unstable at this point; however, plan will be for hopeful AICD prior to discharge pending blood cultures (drawn for fever on 2/15/14). Option of VAD/transplant for recurrent VT was discussed with the patient and his family; at this point, they are not ready to pursue this option.

HPI:  65 yo M with h/o niCMP, AI (EF 23%), HTN,  LBBB, endocarditis w/AV/MV repair in 1998, recurrent VT s/p ICD and multiple ablation attempts, thought to have epicardial VT now planned for epicardial VT ablation by Dr. Couper.   


Cardiac history is notable for longstanding NICMP thought to be due to severe AI resulting from remote endocarditis.  He underwent mechanical AVR and MV repair in 1998, as well as ICD placement for primary prevention.  He was then stable for many years until he presented with symptomatic VT/ICD shocks in early January 2014 and underwent two attempted ablations 1/14/14 and 1/28/14 at Yale New Haven.  He then presented again on 2/2/14 with the sensation of his heart racing and and was found to be in slow VT (110-120 BPM rate range, with RBBB morphology) ; Troponins were stably elevated, VSS, PO amiodarone was increased and he was transferred to BWH on a lidocaine gtt.  


At BWH, he underwent attempted VT ablation. Durnig study, VT was induced from the left ventricle base and RFA/EtOH ablation attempted for intramural/epicardial focus of VT, unfortunately ablation was not successful.  IABP was placed intraprocedurally then removed, stable when arrived to floor.  PT would continue to have intermittent VT (requiring shock x 1) over the next few days despite lidocaine gtt, and subsequent quinidineand amiodarone therapy.   Following long episode of VT yesterday with progressive hypotension, IABP and PA line placed with stabilization of pressure and rhythm.  Plan now is for VT ablation by cardiac surgery (Dr. Couper).

I saw and examined Mr. Mersini on 9W with Dr. Berry.  In brief, he is a pleasant 65yoM with longstanding NIDCM, endocarditis s/p AV/MV surgeries in 1998 (mechanical AVR in place), who has recurrent symptomatic VT despite multiple ablation attempts including endocardial, alcohol septal, and now planned epicardial ablation attempt later this week.  Should this latest ablation attempt fail, he will have nothing left but to consider mechanical circulatory support (BIVAD or TAH) or heart transplant.  He is a blood group B.  We will follow closely with you.

Admitting Attending: Benjamin Scirica MD 


Reason for Admission: VT, s/p attempted ablation 


HPI:  65 yo M with h/o niCMP 2/2 longstanding AI (EF 23%), htn, LBBB, endocarditis w/AV/MV repair in 1998, recurrent VT s/p ICD and ablation x2 (both in 1/2014), hypothyroidism, anxiety, admitted to CCU s/p attempted VT ablation on 2/5. 


The patient has had longstanding niCMP thought 2/2 an episode of endocarditis in his 30s, which caused severe AI.  He then underwent AVR and MV repair in 1998, at which point ICD was placed (per patient, for primary prevention) as well.  He reports having no arrhythmia issues and no ICD firings until January of 2014.  He first experienced symptomatic VT in early January, for which he underwent VT ablation at Yale New Haven Hospital on 1/10/14.  He then reports further issues with VT, for which he underwent a repeat ablation on 1/28/14, also at YNHH.  Then two days ago, on 2/2/14, he had the acute onset sensation of racing heart rate, for which he presented to the Griffin Hospital ED in CT.  He did not syncopize or feel pre-syncopal, but was aware of fast heart rate.  Reportedly, on arrival to Griffin he was found to be in slow monomorphic VT (vs that was shown on ICD interrogation--unclear from the records that accompany the patient).  VS initially at Griffin were reportedly remarkable for stable BP and temp of 100.4.  He was then transferred from Griffin to YNHH. 


OSH Course (Yale-New Haven Hospital, 2/2-2/4/14):  

Per discharge summary and MD expect note: 2/2/14 presented with sensation of fast heartbeat, no ICD shocks.  Device interrogation revealed monomorphic VT.  K and Mg "on the lower side" and were repleted.  Amiodarone was increased to 200 mg qday (however this is not c/w patient's report that his home dose is 200 mg alternating with 400 mg daily).  Home Coreg was continued.  Troponin (not specified T or I) was stable but elevated (0.63 and 0.57) with flat CK/MB.  EP consult saw the patient.  Per DC summary, had 5 beats VT on tele while at YNHH.  However, pt arrives on lidocaine gtt (not mentioned in DC summary) and per review of EKGs from YNHH, he has multiple EKGs (most recent from 3 am on 2/4/14) showing VT in the 107-120 BPM rate range, with RBBB morphology.  Per nursing pass off, lido bolus/gtt was started at 11 am on 2/4/14.  Was given 40 mg IV Lasix x1 and diuresed > 1L while at YNHH.  BNP 1290.  No fevers were noted at Yale.  Of note, while there he also reported constipation with mild blood streaking around hard stools (in s/o known hemorrhoids).  VS on DC: 98.2 94 114/74 27 95% 2L NC.  HD stable throughout his course.  Xferred to BWH for evaluation for a third VT ablation by Dr. Stevenson. 


The patient was admitted to the B-team on 2/4 with plans for EP ablation the following morning.  At that time he arrived feeling well, without chest pain, cough, abdominal pain, or N/V.  He walked multiple miles multiple times a day with his wife up until last month, and since then has cut down his exercise considerably due to anxiety about having VT (he has had no increase in symptoms with exertion, however).  He has had no recent medication changes.  He has been on amiodarone for many decades, per his report.  He cannot recall when his last ICD shock was, though does know that he has had shocks in he past month, and is extremely nervous about being shocked again.  His arrhythmia episodes are accompanied by a sensation of anxiety and fast heart rate, but not by chest pain or syncope/lightheadedness. 


ICU Course (2/5-2/7): 


On 2/5 the patient underwent attempted VT ablation at BWH.  Able to induce VT from the left ventricle base but was not amenable to ablation as it was likely intramural scar that could not be approached from within the heart.  Alcohol ablation was thus performed into an OM feeding the area. Initially appeared successful but then recurrent VT at that focus was induced. IABP was placed intraprocedurally and epinephrine administered for augmented BP during episodes of VT but was removed in the EP lab.  Extubated in EP lab.  Both femorals were accessed, Perclose devices were used on bilateral femoral arteries. R venous sheath retained at time of transfer. Off pressors at the time of arrival to the CCU.  


Overnight after the procedure the patient had three periods of intermittent VT, each with HRs in the 110s and each lasting 30-60 seconds. The patient was asymptomatic during these episodes and each resolved spontaneously. The patient's SBP transiently dropped to the 90s during one of the episodes but in general his SBPs remained in the 110s or greater. The next morning, however, the patient again recurred into VT with a HR of 110. This episode was more sustained. The patient's BP was stable so a lidocaine bolus was given and he was started on a lidocaine drip at 1mg/min. After approximately 20 minutes the patient became lightheaded so the patient was lightly sedated and one shock was delivered which converted the patient out of VT into sinus rhythm. EP recommended starting quinidine sulfate 200mg q8H and a first dose was given shortly thereafter. Lidocaine gtt turned off later that evening. On quinidine, the patient has had no further episodes of VT. EP changed ICD device setting to 110 threshold for ATP. Venous sheath was pulled.

Floor Course (2/7-2/10): 

Amiodarone was titrated down to 200mg PO daily (had been on alternating doses of 200 and 400mg daily). Had sustained VT x 1 hour starting at 6AM the day after transfer, rate 95 BPM. Was hemodynamically stable throughout episode, reported some palpitations but denied CP, SOB, lightheadedness, nausea during episode. Received lido bolus and gtt was started at 1mg/min. Also uptitrated quinidine sulfate to 300mg PO TID. Did well initially thereafter, having only short recurrent episodes of VT that were asymptomatic and without hemodynamic compromise. The day prior to transfer, lidocaine gtt was stopped around noon. Patient again had sustained VT at around 9pm but again with rates<110, so lidocaine re-bolused x2 and drip restarted. At 11:30pm, VT resumed and the patient has been in VT with rates in the 90s-100s continuously since (now >5hr). Amiodarone 50mg bolus was given x2 followed by amiodarone drip at 1mg/min. Despite persistent VT, patient is asymptomatic and SBPs 90s-100s. Of note, thyroid function tests re-sent and were within normal limits.

Studies:  

EKGs on Admission: Flipping between (1) NSR in the 90s with 1st degree AV block, wide LBBB pattern and (2) VT in the 90s with wide QRS, with V1 upright 


CXR 2/7: 

     AP portable chest examination is compared with a similar study
     performed on 2/6/2014 and demonstrates cardiac enlargement. There
     is no edema. No pneumothorax is seen. There is no pleural
     effusion. ICD is in acceptable position. The mediastinum is
     widened. There is no pneumothorax.

ECHO:
Date:  02/05/2014 08:39 


Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is mild to moderately dilated. There is 
left ventricular hypertrophy with relative anteroseptal thinning. The 
visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is severely reduced at 
20-25%. There is global hypokinesis with regional variation, affecting the 
basal anterior and inferior septum and apex severely. Abnormal (paradoxical) 
motion is consistent with post-operative status and bundle branch block. No 
obvious left ventricular thrombus is detected.

Right Ventricle: The right ventricular size is normal. Global RV systolic 
function is low normal. A pacemaker or AICD wires are seen in the right 
heart.
Left Atrium: Normal left atrial size.
Right Atrium: The right atrium is normal in size.
Aortic Valve: A mechanical aortic prosthesis appears well-seated with normal 
function. The peak antegrade aortic valve velocity is 2.6 m/s. The peak 
instantaneous aortic valve gradient is 27 mmHg. The mean aortic valve 
gradient is 16 mmHg (averaged over multiple beats). There is no significant 
aortic regurgitation.
Mitral Valve: The mitral valve is status post repair with an annuloplasty 
ring. Trace mitral regurgitation is present.
Tricuspid Valve: The tricuspid valve is structurally normal. Trace tricuspid 
valve regurgitation is present. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be accurately estimated.
Pulmonic Valve: Structurally normal pulmonic valve. There is no pulmonary 
valve regurgitation.
Aorta: The aortic root size is borderline dilated, measuring 4.0 cm at the 
sinuses.
Pulmonary Artery: The pulmonary artery appears normal in size.
Venous: The inferior vena cava was not well seen.
Pericardium/Pleura: There is a pericardial fat pad. 

Comparison /Summary: No prior BWH studies or reports for comparison.

1/7/14 TTE: Severely increased LV size, normal wall thickness, severe global systolic dysfunction, EF 13%, normal RV size, moderately increased systolic function, mechanical prosthetic aortic valve, bileaflet tilting disk type, well seated, no significant stenosis or regurg. 


2/3/14 TTE: Severely increased LV size with normal wall thickness.  Severe global HK.  Marked septal dyssynergy.  EF 23%.  Normal RV size with mildly decreased systolic function.  Mechanical prosthetic aortic valve, well seated, no leak.  No significant effusion.  No significant change from 1/7/14. 


Assessment and Plan:  

65 yo M with h/o niCMP (EF 23%), HTN, LBBB, AVR/MV repair in 1998, recurrent VT s/p ICD and ablation x2, hypothyroidism, anxiety, p/w recurrent VT now s/p alcohol ablation to OM on 2/5 but with recurrent VT necessitating initiation of quinidine therapy. 


# Sustained VT: Pt with h/o niCMP and VT in the past s/p ablation x2 in January 2014, transferred to BWH with recurrent VT for repeat ablation. Latest attempt at VT ablation challenging, as it appears a transmural scar is responsible per EP lab results. EtOH ablation delivered to an OM branch, but VT still inducible. Episode of sustained VT occurred on 2/8 after Quinidine 200mg TID initiated; treated with Lido gtt with initial response.

Date of ICU Admission: 2/5/14 

Date of Floor Transfer: 2/7/2014 

Admitting Attending: Benjamin Scirica MD 


Reason for Admission: VT, s/p attempted ablation 


HPI:  65 yo M with h/o niCMP 2/2 longstanding AI (EF 23%), htn, LBBB, endocarditis w/AV/MV repair in 1998, recurrent VT s/p ICD and ablation x2 (both in 1/2014), hypothyroidism, anxiety, admitted to CCU s/p attempted VT ablation on 2/5. 


The patient has had longstanding niCMP thought 2/2 an episode of endocarditis in his 30s, which caused severe AI.  He then underwent AVR and MV repair in 1998, at which point ICD was placed (per patient, for primary prevention) as well.  He reports having no arrhythmia issues and no ICD firings until January of 2014.  He first experienced symptomatic VT in early January, for which he underwent VT ablation at Yale New Haven Hospital on 1/10/14.  He then reports further issues with VT, for which he underwent a repeat ablation on 1/28/14, also at YNHH.  Then two days ago, on 2/2/14, he had the acute onset sensation of racing heart rate, for which he presented to the Griffin Hospital ED in CT.  He did not syncopize or feel pre-syncopal, but was aware of fast heart rate.  Reportedly, on arrival to Griffin he was found to be in slow monomorphic VT (vs that was shown on ICD interrogation--unclear from the records that accompany the patient).  VS initially at Griffin were reportedly remarkable for stable BP and temp of 100.4.  He was then transferred from Griffin to YNHH. 


OSH Course (Yale-New Haven Hospital, 2/2-2/4/14):  

Per discharge summary and MD expect note: 2/2/14 presented with sensation of fast heartbeat, no ICD shocks.  Device interrogation revealed monomorphic VT.  K and Mg "on the lower side" and were repleted.  Amiodarone was increased to 200 mg qday (however this is not c/w patient's report that his home dose is 200 mg alternating with 400 mg daily).  Home Coreg was continued.  Troponin (not specified T or I) was stable but elevated (0.63 and 0.57) with flat CK/MB.  EP consult saw the patient.  Per DC summary, had 5 beats VT on tele while at YNHH.  However, pt arrives on lidocaine gtt (not mentioned in DC summary) and per review of EKGs from YNHH, he has multiple EKGs (most recent from 3 am on 2/4/14) showing VT in the 107-120 BPM rate range, with RBBB morphology.  Per nursing pass off, lido bolus/gtt was started at 11 am on 2/4/14.  Was given 40 mg IV Lasix x1 and diuresed > 1L while at YNHH.  BNP 1290.  No fevers were noted at Yale.  Of note, while there he also reported constipation with mild blood streaking around hard stools (in s/o known hemorrhoids).  VS on DC: 98.2 94 114/74 27 95% 2L NC.  HD stable throughout his course.  Xferred to BWH for evaluation for a third VT ablation by Dr. Stevenson. 


The patient was admitted to the B-team on 2/4 with plans for EP ablation the following morning.  At that time he arrived feeling well, without chest pain, cough, abdominal pain, or N/V.  He walked multiple miles multiple times a day with his wife up until last month, and since then has cut down his exercise considerably due to anxiety about having VT (he has had no increase in symptoms with exertion, however).  He has had no recent medication changes.  He has been on amiodarone for many decades, per his report.  He cannot recall when his last ICD shock was, though does know that he has had shocks in he past month, and is extremely nervous about being shocked again.  His arrhythmia episodes are accompanied by a sensation of anxiety and fast heart rate, but not by chest pain or syncope/lightheadedness. 


ICU Course: 


On 2/5 the patient underwent attempted VT ablation at BWH.  Able to induce VT from the left ventricle base but was not amenable to ablation as it was likely intramural scar that could not be approached from within the heart.  Alcohol ablation was thus performed into an OM feeding the area. Initially appeared successful but then recurrent VT at that focus was induced. IABP was placed intraprocedurally and epinephrine administered for augmented BP during episodes of VT but was removed in the EP lab.  Extubated in EP lab.  Both femorals were accessed, Perclose devices were used on bilateral femoral arteries. R venous sheath retained at time of transfer. Off pressors at the time of arrival to the CCU.  


Overnight after the procedure the patient had three periods of intermittent VT, each with HRs in the 110s and each lasting 30-60 seconds. The patient was asymptomatic during these episodes and each resolved spontaneously. The patient's SBP transiently dropped to the 90s during one of the episodes but in general his SBPs remained in the 110s or greater. The next morning, however, the patient again recurred into VT with a HR of 110. This episode was more sustained. The patient's BP was stable so a lidocaine bolus was given and he was started on a lidocaine drip at 1mg/min. After approximately 20 minutes the patient became lightheaded so the patient was lightly sedated and one shock was delivered which converted the patient out of VT into sinus rhythm. EP recommended starting quinidine sulfate 200mg q8H and a first dose was given shortly thereafter. Lidocaine gtt turned off later that evening. On quinidine, the patient has had no further episodes of VT. EP changed ICD device setting to 110 threshold for ATP. Venous sheath was pulled.

CCU Fellow Admit Note  

ATTENDING: Benjamin Scirica, MD 


Reason for Admission: Post ablation monitoring 


History of the Present Illness: 

65M with PMH of long-standing cardiomyopathy s/p mechanical AVR with multiple recent salvos of symptomatic VT who now presents to CCU for monitoring following repeat ablation attempt. 


As detailed below, patient had done well for quite some time on oral amiodarone until presenting to Yale Hospital in January 2014 with symptomatic VT requiring ablations x2. He represented to an OSH soon after discharge wiht recurrent palpitations and monomorphic VT. He was started on lidocaine gtt in advance of BWH transfer for repeat ablation effort with Dr. William Stevenson. TTE performed on 2/5/2014 notable for dilate LV (6.4 cm) with anteroseptal thinning. EF 20-25% with anterobasal and inferoseptal territory most affected. RV normal in size with with mildly reduced function. Well-seated mechanical AV with peak 27/mean 16. Trace MR s/p annuloplasty repair. Trace TR. Mild aortic root dilation (4.0 cm). 


On day of ablation, 3 distinct RBBB monomorphic VT morphologies were noted, thought to be from intramural or epicardial scar at mid lateral inferior LV. He underwent RF ablation and ultimately a transcoronary EtOH ablation of a small marginal vessel (OM3 based on my review of his angiographic images) was performed. A 1.5 mm balloon was used to occlude the vessel in advance of 2 cc's of EtOH injection.  Substrate was ultimately modified but VT was still inducible. The procedure was performed wtih IABP support via the right common femoral artery given SBP in 60's during VT -> augmented to 90, removed in advance of CCU transfer. 


Perclose devices were used on bilateral femoral arteries. R venous sheath retained at time of transfer. 


Patient feels well following procedure, noting only mild chronic back pain that was exacerbated by lying on the table.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 

65M with nonischemic CMP and depressed EF with recurrent episodic VT in recent weeks with unclear underlying trigger. No clear evidence of ischemia, hyperthyroidism, substantial electrolyte disturbance, or novel medication offenders. Based on intramural location of presumed scar, he is now s/p alcohol ablation which was at least partially successful in VT substrate modification. He has an ICD in place with ATP to be triggered by HR > 145. He is mildly hypervolemic on my exam. 

--Appreciate EP recs moving forward. We will continue carvedilol and consider uptitration as tolerated in coming days. We will resume amiodarone 400 / 200. Anxiety will be controlled with low dose benzodiazepines. 

--Maintain K and Mg 

--Avoid additional QTc prolonging medications (other than amiodarone), although his lengthy QRS accounts for a substantial proportion of his interval lengthening. 

--Monitor on telemetry for recurrent salvos of VT. 

--Likely remove femoral venous sheath in next 6-12 hours once heparin is no longer in system if no need for centrally acting medications is warranted. 

--Continue coumadin for mechanical aortic valve. 

--Possible transfer to B team if remains clinically stable. 


Patient will be staffed with CV attending Benjamin Scirica in AM.

Date of Admission: 2/5/2014 

Admitting Attending: Benjamin Scirica MD 

Reason for Admission: VT, s/p attempted ablation 


HPI:  65 yo M with h/o niCMP 2/2 longstanding AI (EF 23%), htn, LBBB, endocarditis w/AV/MV repair in 1998, recurrent VT s/p ICD and ablation x2 (both in 1/2014), hypothyroidism, anxiety, admitted to CCU s/p attempted VT ablation on 2/5. 


The patient has had longstanding niCMP thought 2/2 an episode of endocarditis in his 30s, which caused severe AI.  He then underwent AVR and MV repair in 1998, at which point ICD was placed (per patient, for primary prevention) as well.  He reports having no arrhythmia issues and no ICD firings until January of 2014.  He first experienced symptomatic VT in early January, for which he underwent VT ablation at Yale New Haven Hospital on 1/10/14.  He then reports further issues with VT, for which he underwent a repeat ablation on 1/28/14, also at YNHH.  Then two days ago, on 2/2/14, he had the acute onset sensation of racing heart rate, for which he presented to the Griffin Hospital ED in CT.  He did not syncopize or feel pre-syncopal, but was aware of fast heart rate.  Reportedly, on arrival to Griffin he was found to be in slow monomorphic VT (vs that was shown on ICD interrogation--unclear from the records that accompany the patient).  VS initially at Griffin were reportedly remarkable for stable BP and temp of 100.4.  He was then transferred from Griffin to YNHH. 


OSH Course (Yale-New Haven Hospital, 2/2-2/4/14):  

Per discharge summary and MD expect note: 2/2/14 presented with sensation of fast heartbeat, no ICD shocks.  Device interrogation revealed monomorphic VT.  K and Mg "on the lower side" and were repleted.  Amiodarone was increased to 200 mg qday (however this is not c/w patient's report that his home dose is 200 mg alternating with 400 mg daily).  Home Coreg was continued.  Troponin (not specified T or I) was stable but elevated (0.63 and 0.57) with flat CK/MB.  EP consult saw the patient.  Per DC summary, had 5 beats VT on tele while at YNHH.  However, pt arrives on lidocaine gtt (not mentioned in DC summary) and per review of EKGs from YNHH, he has multiple EKGs (most recent from 3 am on 2/4/14) showing VT in the 107-120 BPM rate range, with RBBB morphology.  Per nursing pass off, lido bolus/gtt was started at 11 am on 2/4/14.  Was given 40 mg IV Lasix x1 and diuresed > 1L while at YNHH.  BNP 1290.  No fevers were noted at Yale.  Of note, while there he also reported constipation with mild blood streaking around hard stools (in s/o known hemorrhoids).  VS on DC: 98.2 94 114/74 27 95% 2L NC.  HD stable throughout his course.  Xferred to BWH for evaluation for a third VT ablation by Dr. Stevenson. 


The patient was admitted to the B-team on 2/4 with plans for EP ablation the following morning.  At that time he arrived feeling well, without chest pain, cough, abdominal pain, or N/V.  He walked multiple miles multiple times a day with his wife up until last month, and since then has cut down his exercise considerably due to anxiety about having VT (he has had no increase in symptoms with exertion, however).  He has had no recent medication changes.  He has been on amiodarone for many decades, per his report.  He cannot recall when his last ICD shock was, though does know that he has had shocks in he past month, and is extremely nervous about being shocked again.  His arrhythmia episodes are accompanied by a sensation of anxiety and fast heart rate, but not by chest pain or syncope/lightheadedness. 


On 2/5 the patient underwent attempted VT ablation at BWH.  Offical OP report is pending at this time but per verbal passoff EP was able to induce VT from the left ventricle base but was not amenable to ablation as it was likely intramural scar that could not be approached intracardially.  Alcohol ablation at the OM initially appeared successful but then recurrent VT at that focus was induced--unclear if successful, will need more time to tell.  IABP was placed intraprocedurally and epinephrine administered for augmented BP during episodes of VT but was removed in the EP lab.  Extubated in EP lab.  Both femorals were accessed, Perclose devices were used on bilateral femoral arteries. R venous sheath retained at time of transfer. Off pressors at the time of arrival to the CCU. Feels well.

     The patient status post AVR and median sternotomy. The pacemaker
     leads terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle. The
     heart is mildly enlarged. The lungs are clear without pulmonary
     edema. No pneumothorax is seen.

ECHO:
Date:  02/05/2014 08:39 


Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is mild to moderately dilated. There is 
left ventricular hypertrophy with relative anteroseptal thinning. The 
visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is severely reduced at 
20-25%. There is global hypokinesis with regional variation, affecting the 
basal anterior and inferior septum and apex severely. Abnormal (paradoxical) 
motion is consistent with post-operative status and bundle branch block. No 
obvious left ventricular thrombus is detected.

Right Ventricle: The right ventricular size is normal. Global RV systolic 
function is low normal. A pacemaker or AICD wires are seen in the right 
heart.
Left Atrium: Normal left atrial size.
Right Atrium: The right atrium is normal in size.
Aortic Valve: A mechanical aortic prosthesis appears well-seated with normal 
function. The peak antegrade aortic valve velocity is 2.6 m/s. The peak 
instantaneous aortic valve gradient is 27 mmHg. The mean aortic valve 
gradient is 16 mmHg (averaged over multiple beats). There is no significant 
aortic regurgitation.
Mitral Valve: The mitral valve is status post repair with an annuloplasty 
ring. Trace mitral regurgitation is present.
Tricuspid Valve: The tricuspid valve is structurally normal. Trace tricuspid 
valve regurgitation is present. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be accurately estimated.
Pulmonic Valve: Structurally normal pulmonic valve. There is no pulmonary 
valve regurgitation.
Aorta: The aortic root size is borderline dilated, measuring 4.0 cm at the 
sinuses.
Pulmonary Artery: The pulmonary artery appears normal in size.

Pericardium/Pleura: There is a pericardial fat pad. 

Comparison /Summary: No prior BWH studies or reports for comparison.

1/7/14 TTE: Severely increased LV size, normal wall thickness, severe global systolic dysfunction, EF 13%, normal RV size, moderately increased systolic function, mechanical prosthetic aortic valve, bileaflet tilting disk type, well seated, no significant stenosis or regurg. 


2/3/14 TTE: Severely increased LV size with normal wall thickness.  Severe global HK.  Marked septal dyssynergy.  EF 23%.  Normal RV size with mildly decreased systolic function.  Mechanical prosthetic aortic valve, well seated, no leak.  No significant effusion.  No significant change from 1/7/14. 


Assessment: 65 yo M with h/o niCMP (EF 23%), htn, LBBB, AVR/MV repair in 1998, recurrent VT s/p ICD and ablation x2, hypothyroidism, anxiety, p/w recurrent VT now s/p alcohol ablation to OM on 2/5 admitted to CCU for monitoring. 


Plan: 

#VT: Pt with h/o niCMP and VT in the past s/p ablation x2 in January 2014, now with recurrent VT.  Most recent EKGs show monomorphic VT with RBBB-like morphology (last at 3 am 2/4/14).  Given lack of chest pain, no known dx of CAD, and monomorphic VT, suspect that this VT is related to his severely dysfunctional LV rather than to active ischemia.  Troponin elevated but stable at YNHH (with flat CK/MB x2) also argues against acute ischemic insult as etiology of current VT episode. (Demand ischemia more likely the explanation for Tn elevation). Latest attempt at VT ablation challenging, as it appears a transmural scar is responsible per EP lab results. EtOH ablation delivered to an OM branch, but VT still inducible thereafter. If successful, may take some time to have effect. 

- appreciate EP recs, will continue to discuss case 

- CTM on telemetry for recurrent VT post-procedure 

- maintain K and Mg 

- Likely remove femoral venous sheath in next 6-12 hours if no need for centrally acting medications 

- Resume home amio 200 mg-400 mg alternating days post-procedue per EP 

- No further lidocaine post procedure 

- Continue home Coreg 6.25 mg BID 


#niCMP: Pt with EF 13-23% on most recent 2 TTEs (per OSH reports).  CMP related to prior valvular disease (AI) that was a sequelae of endocarditis, per patient report.  Mild crackles at the R base and minimal O2 requirement but appears relatively euvolemic on exam. 

- Will obtain TTE at BWH, as above 

- Continue home Coreg 6.25 mg BID 

- Continue enalapril 20 mg qday 

- Continue home Lasix 40 mg PO qday 

- Strict I/O (though would DC Foley following ablation), 2g/2L diet when eating 

- Consider upgrade to BiV ICD given LBBB + systolic heart failure 


# Mechanical AVR: 

- Continue coumadin with goal INR 2-3 (home dosing alternates between 1.5 and 2 mg qpm, per patient); will hold tonight's dose

Dear Dr. Casablanca,  


Your patient, Ramadan Mersini was transfered to the Brigham and Women's Hospital on 02/03/14 for management of his recurrent ventricular tachycardia.  As you know, he is a 65-year-old gentleman with a longstanding history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, ICD, aortic regurgitation secondary to endocarditis status post aortic valve replacement and mitral valve repair, who had been doing relatively well until January 2014, when he developed palpitations and subsequently was found to be in ventricular tachycardia.  He has undegone 2 VT ablations at Yale-New Haven Hospital in January. On 01/10/14, he was found to have a large anterior scar and good pace maps with delay at the anterior septal aspect.  Ablation was successful and VT was noninducible at the end of the procedure.  Unfortunately, 2 days after discharge he had recurrent ventricular tachycardia and a repeat ablation was performed on 01/28/14 with localization of the VT to a septal scar.  Radiofrequency ablation was performed to the anterior aspect of the scar and no VT was inducible with triple extrastimuli and isoproterenol infusion.  Unfortunately, the VT again recurred and the patient is nowtransferred for further management of VT. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% to 20% thought secondary to the development of severe aortic regurgitation following an episode of endocarditis, subsequent to a dental infection the patient had pain in his 30s.  He underwent a primary prevention ICD in 1998 and had not had a shock until recently.  Aortic valve replacement with a mechanical valve and mitral valve repair in 1998, ventricular tachycardia with 2 prior VT ablations this month, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, and hypothyroidism. 


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 


HOME MEDICATIONS:  Amiodarone 200 mg once daily, carvedilol 6.25 mg once daily, Lasix 40 mg once daily, warfarin 2 mg once daily, dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily, levothyroxine 50 mcg once daily, lisinopril 40 mg once daily, Ativan 2 mg every 6 hours, magnesium oxide 400 mg once daily, potassium chloride 40 mEq once daily, rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily. 


FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac death. 


SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives at home with his wife in Derby, Connecticut.  He is retired.  He is active with his hobbies which include fishing, yardwork, gardening and playing with his grandchildren.  He does not drink and has never smoked. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, pulse 98.4, beats per minute and regular, blood pressure 134/90 mmHg, oxygen saturation is 97% on 2 liters.  He is in no acute distress and speaking in full sentences.  He is anxious during the examination.  The pupils are equal and round.  His neck is supple without lymphadenopathy, masses, or bruits.  His jugular venous pressure is not elevated.  His heart is regular with a normal 1st and mechanical 2nd heart sound that is paradoxically split.  He has a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  His abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended without organomegaly, masses or bruits.  His extremities are warm and well perfused with good distal pulses and no edema.  There are no hematomas or bruits at his prior femoral access site. 


LABORATORY VALUES:  Electrocardiogram reveals sinus rhythm with 1st-degree AV block and left bundle-branch block morphology.  There are ECGs in the chart that demonstrate ventricular tachycardia with multiple etiologies.  Both are right bundle morphology, but one has a precordial transition at V4-V5 any other  V3-V6. 


A transthoracic echocardiogram on 02/03/14 revealed a severely dilated LV with severe global hypokinesis.  His EF was estimated at 23%.  The mechanical aortic valve was well-seated with no perivalvular leak.  His echo report was unchanged from her prior on 01/07/14. 


Interrogation of his device by our Electrophysiology colleagues on admission here revealed numerous VT episodes with appropriate device therapy. 


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Mersini is a 65-year-old gentleman with longstanding history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, status post mechanical aortic valve replacement, mitral valve repair and recurrent ventricular tachycardia with 2 prior ablations for this month.  He is planned to go to the electrophysiology lab this morning for a 3rd ventricular tachycardia ablation attempt via transeptal approach as well as transcoronary ethanol ablation.   He does not appear to be have any signs or symptoms of ischemia or volume overload and we will maintain him on his outpatient heart failure regimen.  We will also continue anticoagulation for his mechanical aortic valve. 


Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient and we will continue to update you on the status of his admission. 


Sincerely,

EP Fellow Consult Note 


Reason for consult: VT 


HPI: 65M c h/o NICMP likely related endocarditis related aortic insufficiency who underwent mechanical AVR and mitral valve repair approximately 10 years ago.  A secondary prevention ICD was implanted at that time as well, and epicardial patches were placed due to inability to successfully defibrillate endocardially.  He was maintained on amiodarone and reports that he remained largely free of recurrent arrhythmia until one month ago when he presented to an OSH with palpitations and was found to be in VT.  He reports that his primary symptoms of arrhythmia are palpitations and occaisional LH.  He denies any prior presyncope/syncope.  He underwent EPS/ablation 1/10/14 via transseptal approach.  He was found to have large anterior scar and good pace-maps with delay at anterolateral aspect.  Ablation through this region rendered VT non-inducbile.  Two days after discharge, however, VT recurred and pt presented again for evaluation.  A repeat ablation was performed 1/28/14 at which time VT was localized to septal scar and VT was terminated with RF at anterior aspect of septal scar.  Subsequently no VT was inducbile with triple extrastimuli and isoproterenol infusion.  Pt with recurrent VT after discarge, was readmitted, and transferred here for further management.  On day of transfer pt was initiated on lidocaine gtt however it is unclear what prompted this.  At time of evaluation, pt is very anxious but is otherwise without complaint.  He denies CP/sob, palp/LH/dizziness/presyncope, no PND/orthopnea/LE edema.

2) RB morphology in V1, indeterminate frontal plane axis, rS complexes V3-V6 at 147 bpm 


1/7/14 TTE: Severely increased LV size, normal wall thickness, severe global systolic dysfunction, EF 13%, normal RV size, moderately increased systolic function, mechanical prosthetic aortic valve, bileaflet tilting disk type, well seated, no significant stenosis or regurg.  


2/3/14 TTE: Severely increased LV size with normal wall thickness.  Severe global HK.  Marked septal dyssynergy.  EF 23%.  Normal RV size with mildly decreased systolic function.  Mechanical prosthetic aortic valve, well seated, no leak.  No significant effusion.  No significant change from 1/7/14. 


IMP/REC:  65M c h/o NICMP, mech AVR, mitral valve repair, recurrent VT and secondary prevention ICD with epicardial patches with frequent recurrent VT over the past month despite amiodarone and EPS/endocardial ablation x 2.  He is now transferred here for further management.  I extensively discussed risks and benefits of endocardial VT ablation via a transseptal approach as well as transcoronary ethanol ablation.  Risks of procedure d/w pt include, but are not limited to, bleeding, infection, heart block, tamponade, stroke, MI, and death.  Pt understands and wishes to proceed. 

-NPO p MN  

-d/c lidocaine gtt at 2am, hold amiodarone 

-if VT o/n after lidocaine stopped can initiate esmolol gtt 

-check TTE in AM 

-stat INR, continue warfarin in INR < 3 

-will follow

Patient: Ramadan MERSINI 

MRN: 28977601 

Date of Admission: 2/4/14 

Code Status: FULL CODE (confirmed) 


Inpatient Attending: Dr. Ruff 

PCP: Domenic Casablanca (Shelton, CT) 

Emergency Contact: Wife Melia Mersini 203-516-1936; son Rezart Mersini 860-967-1860 


CC: 65 yo M with VT 


HPI: 65 yo M with h/o niCMP 2/2 longstanding AI (EF 23%), htn, LBBB, AVR/MV repair in 1998, recurrent VT s/p ICD and ablation x2 (both in 1/2014), hypothyroidism, anxiety, p/w recurrent VT. 


The patient has had longstanding niCMP thought 2/2 an episode of endocarditis in his 30s, which caused severe AI.  He then underwent AVR and MV repair in 1998, at which point ICD was placed (per patient, for primary prevention) as well.  He reports having no arrhythmia issues and no ICD firings until January of 2014.  He first experienced symptomatic VT in early January, for which he underwent VT ablation at Yale New Haven Hospital on 1/10/14.  He then reports further issues with VT, for which he underwent a repeat ablation on 1/28/14, also at YNHH.  Then two days ago, on 2/2/14, he had the acute onset sensation of racing heart rate, for which he presented to the Griffin Hospital ED in CT.  He did not syncopize or feel pre-syncopal, but was aware of fast heart rate.  Reportedly, on arrival to Griffin he was found to be in slow monomorphic VT (vs that was shown on ICD interrogation--unclear from the records that accompany the patient).  VS initially at Griffin were reportedly remarkable for stable BP and temp of 100.4.  He was then transferred from Griffin to YNHH. 


OSH Course (Yale-New Haven Hospital, 2/2-2/4/14):  

Per discharge summary and MD expect note: 2/2/14 presented with sensation of fast heartbeat, no ICD shocks.  Device interrogation revealed monomorphic VT.  K and Mg "on the lower side" and were repleted.  Amiodarone was increased to 200 mg qday (however this is not c/w patient's report that his home dose is 200 mg alternating with 400 mg daily).  Home Coreg was continued.  Troponin (not specified T or I) was stable but elevated (0.63 and 0.57) with flat CK/MB.  EP consult saw the patient.  Per DC summary, had 5 beats VT on tele while at YNHH.  However, pt arrives on lidocaine gtt (not mentioned in DC summary) and per review of EKGs from YNHH, he has multiple EKGs (most recent from 3 am on 2/4/14) showing VT in the 107-120 BPM rate range, with RBBB morphology.  Per nursing pass off, lido bolus/gtt was started at 11 am on 2/4/14.  Was given 40 mg IV Lasix x1 and diuresed > 1L while at YNHH.  BNP 1290.  No fevers were noted at Yale.  Of note, while there he also reported constipation with mild blood streaking around hard stools (in s/o known hemorrhoids).  VS on DC: 98.2 94 114/74 27 95% 2L NC.  HD stable throughout his course.  Xferred to BWH for evaluation for a third VT ablation by Dr. Stevenson. 


On arrival to BWH, the patient is feeling well, without chest pain, cough, abdominal pain, or N/V.  He denies dysuria or urinary frequency previously (now has Foley in place).  He denies LEE or worsening orthopnea.  He walked multiple miles multiple times a day with his wife up until last month, and since then has cut down his exercise considerably due to anxiety about having VT (he has had no increase in symptoms with exertion, however).  He has had no recent medication changes.  He has been on amiodarone for many decades, per his report.  He cannot recall when his last ICD shock was, though does know that he has had shocks in he past month, and is extremely nervous about being shocked again.  His arrhythmia episodes are accompanied by a sensation of anxiety and fast heart rate, but not by chest pain or syncope/lightheadedness.

Plan: 

# VT: Pt with h/o niCMP and VT in the past s/p ablation x2 in January 2014, now with recurrent VT.  Most recent EKGs show monomorphic VT with RBBB-like morphology (last at 3 am 2/4/14).  Per review with EP fellow, multiple strips from prior EPS that also show other types of VT.  Given lack of chest pain, no known dx of CAD, and monomorphic VT, suspect that this VT is related to his severely dysfunctional LV rather than to active ischemia.  Troponin elevated but stable at YNHH (with flat CK/MB x2) also argues against acute ischemic insult as etiology of current VT episode. (Demand ischemia more likely the explanation for Tn elevation). 

- EP consulted and saw patient on arrival, greatly appreciate recs 

- Plan for potential VT ablation with Dr. Stevenson in AM; pt NPO p MN 

- Plan to hold home amio (pt states home dose is 200 mg-400 mg alternating days) per EP, in anticipation of ablation 

- Continue lido gtt at 1 mg/min on arrival, but turn off at 2 am per EP, again in anticipation of ablation 

- Continue home Coreg 6.25 mg BID 

- TTE early in AM to r/o LV thrombus per EP fellow 

- pCXR overnight per EP: obtained, read pending 

- Obtain stat EKG if further VT, for help with localization 

- Tele 


# niCMP: Pt with EF 13-23% on most recent 2 TTEs (per OSH reports).  CMP related to prior valvular disease (AI) that was a sequelae of endocarditis, per patient report.  Mild crackles at the R base and minimal O2 requirement but appears relatively euvolemic on exam. 

- Will obtain TTE at BWH, as above 

- Continue home Coreg 6.25 mg BID, home lisinopril 40 mg qday 

- Continue home Lasix 40 mg PO qday 

- Strict I/O (though would DC Foley following ablation), 2g/2L diet when eating

Dear Anju, 


As we discussed briefly on the phone late this morning, I implanted a CRT/D system in Stephen Thompson today.  The indication for ICD therapy was chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction of 25%, with persistent symptoms of heart failure despite a full medical program; the additional indication for resynchronization therapy was left bundle-branch block with QRS duration of 160 milliseconds.  Thus, he qualified both for ICD primary prevention therapy as well as cardiac resynchronization therapy according to evidence-based guidelines and the CMS National Coverage Determination. 


I met with him in the recovery room to discuss the rationale, risk, benefits, and alternatives to proceeding in careful detail.  All of his questions were addressed and he agreed to the procedure. 


The biggest issue we had was that he was fidgety throughout, complaining of a variety of minor things that resulted in a lot of unnecessary movement for which we had to continuously admonish him. 


He had a single coronary vein serving the entire posterior wall of the left ventricle.  This vein had 3 side branches, all of which I mapped.  Two of the side branches yielded extra cardiac stimulation (phrenic nerve); the third side branch did not, but yielded due to local scar, a best obtainable capture threshold of about 4 volts.  We took it because there was no alternative. 


Otherwise, things procedure without incident.  I anticipated an overnight stay with resumption of all of his medications including anticoagulation.  I will arrange to see him routinely. 


Sincerely,

Dear Ranbir: 


I had the pleasure of seeing Stephen Thompson in followup in the Brigham and Women's Cardiomyopathy Clinic today.  As you know, Mr. Thompson is a 65-year-old gentleman with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and an EF of 34-35%.  He is status post coronary artery bypass grafting.  He also suffers from endstage renal disease and is currently maintained on peritoneal dialysis.  At his last visit with us, we had ordered an exercise MIBI to evaluate his ischemic burden.  He was able to walk for 4 minutes and 15 seconds on a standard Bruce protocol.  His heart rate increased from 61 beats per minute at rest to 123 beats per minute at peak exercise.  His blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg at rest to 178/86 mmHg at peak exercise.  He stopped secondary to leg fatigue.  His MIBI images did not show any evidence of ischemia at rest or with stress.  His EF was only 26%.  He now comes in to follow up on these results and to rediscuss his eligibility for renal transplantation. 


From a symptomatic standpoint, he continues to work as a chiropractor.  He does not notice any limitations in his daily living.  He denies any orthopnea, PND, or pedal edema.  He denies any palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.  He denies any chest discomfort.  The remainder of his review of systems is negative. 


His current medications include aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, carvedilol 18.75 mg b.i.d., Coumadin, Lasix 60 mg in the morning and 40 mg in the evening, PhosLo 667 mg t.i.d., and warfarin. 


On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 69 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 188/89.  His weight is 236 pounds.  His neck exam shows no evidence of jugular venous distention.  His carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits.  His lungs are clear bilaterally.  His cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2.  No S3, S4, or murmurs are appreciated.  His abdominal exam is benign without hepatosplenomegaly.  His extremities reveal no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema and are warm and well perfused. 


My review of his EKG shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 69 beats per minute with evidence of a left bundle-branch block.  He has a QRS duration of 158 milliseconds. 


His most recent laboratory values from 09/29 revealed a sodium of 137, potassium of 3.6, BUN of 57, and creatinine of 4.87.  His glucose is markedly elevated at 180. 


In summary, Mr. Thompson is a 65-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease, now with an ischemic cardiomyopathy and an EF of 25-30%.  He also suffers from end-stage renal disease and is on peritoneal dialysis, pending a decision to be listed for renal transplant.  I discussed his cardiac findings with Dr. Vadivel of the Renal Transplant Service.  It is likely that his cardiomyopathy will persist even after renal transplantation.  Since he is now being dialyzed, it is hard to assess what his functional capacity will be once he is off dialysis and whether or not he will have problems with fluid retention that may impose a burden on his transplanted kidney.  Dr. Vadivel did not feel that this would be an absolute contraindication to transplantation.  However, he did feel that if the patient were eligible for an ICD as primary prevention from a cardiac standpoint, he should get that prior to receiving a kidney transplant.  Given his left bundle-branch block and QRS duration of greater than 150 milliseconds, he would actually benefit from resynchronization therapy.  The patient will discuss his timing of listing with Dr. Vadivel.  Once this has been settled, I will refer him to Dr. Michael Sweeney for implantation of a biventricular ICD.  Otherwise, his blood pressure is poorly controlled.  I have increased his carvedilol to 25 mg b.i.d. and have reinstated his lisinopril 5 mg daily.  I have asked that he have repeat laboratory values checked in 2 weeks' time on these medications. 


Please feel free to contact me with any further questions. 


Sincerely,

CC: Routine f/u 


HPI: Mr. Thompson is a 65M with iCMP s/p CABG, IDDM, HTN, and ESRD on PD being worked up for renal transplantation. He is coming to see me today for routine f/u. He was recently seen by both renal and heart failure. Heart Failure service continues to tweak his cardiac regimen. 


Despite serious comorbidities, Mr. Thompson reports feeling well and maintains an active lifestyle including playing with his grandchildren and making a recent trip to Bermuda. He reports managing the PD without any problems. 


Notably, Mr. Thompson's blood sugars remain less than optimal. He notes that his AM fasting sugars are always less than 200 but not at goal. He is currently using 10 units BID of Humulin and Aspart sliding scale at meals. He notes that he has had some lability to his regimen due to the changing dextrose mixtures within the PD solution.

Dear Dr. Dhillon: 


I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Stephen Thompson, in the Cardiomyopathy Clinic at Brigham and Women's Hospital today.  As you know, Mr. Thompson is a 65-year-old gentleman who was diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy in 2000.  His echo at that time revealed an EF of 30%-35%.  He subsequently underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with a LIMA to the LAD, reverse vein graft to the PDA, and a vein graft to OM2.  His postoperative EF has improved in the 40%-45% range.  He was initially followed by Dr. Mark Creager of the Cardiovascular Service, but then was lost to followup.  He subsequently resumed followup with Dr. Garrick Stewart.  His echocardiogram in 03/2009 revealed an EF of 25%-30% with an end-diastolic dimension of 5.8 cm.  He also had increased wall thickness with an intraventricular septal thickness of 1.3 cm.  He was also noted to have mild mitral and trace tricuspid regurgitation.  The patient was medically managed for his cardiomyopathy and developed diabetic nephropathy with end-stage renal disease approximately a year ago.  He initiated dialysis this year and is currently on peritoneal dialysis.  He is now being referred to us for cardiac evaluation to decide if he would be eligible for a renal transplant. 


From a functional standpoint, the patient states that he works as a chiropractor without significant limitations.  He states that he can walk approximately 1 mile at a slow pace, but becomes short of breath if he hurries.  He lives on the second floor and is able to climb a flight of stairs without any limitations.  He denies any orthopnea or PND, but does note some pedal edema.  He is on peritoneal dialysis and therefore has some abdominal bloating.  He states that he still continues to make urine and takes Lasix to augment this.  He does not have any palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.  He reports that he feels that his quality of life on peritoneal dialysis is very good.  He does not feel that dialysis has impeded his quality of life compared to how he felt before dialysis.  The remainder of his review of systems is negative. 


His past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease as described above, ischemic cardiomyopathy as described above, chronic renal insufficiency on peritoneal dialysis, insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, and anemia. 


The patient has no known drug allergies. 


Social History:  The patient is a former smoker, but denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. 


His family history is noncontributory. 


His current medications include aspirin 81 mg daily, albuterol 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d., amlodipine 10 mg b.i.d., atorvastatin 80 mg daily, carvedilol 12.5 mg b.i.d., Coumadin, iron sulfate 325 mg daily, Lasix 60 mg in the morning and 40 mg in the evening, lisinopril 5 mg daily, Novolin 10 units subcutaneous b.i.d., and PhosLo 667 mg t.i.d. 


On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 76 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 143/80.  His weight is 237 pounds.  His neck exam shows JVP of approximately 12 cm of water.  His carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits.  He has no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  His lungs are clear bilaterally.  His cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2.  He has an audible S3.  No S4 or murmurs are appreciated.  His abdominal exam is bloated with a fluid wave.  His extremities reveal 1+ pitting edema in the right lower extremity and no edema in the left lower extremity. 


My review of his EKG shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 76 beats per minute with evidence of left bundle-branch block.  He has evidence of left atrial enlargement.  This is unchanged compared to his prior EKGs. 


His most recent laboratory values from 06/2010 reveal sodium of 130, potassium of 3.8, BUN of 92, creatinine of 8.67, and glucose of 138.  His liver function tests were within normal limits.  His lipids reveal a cholesterol of 91, triglyceride of 133, HDL of 21, and LDL of 43.  His CBC reveals a white count of 13,000, hematocrit of 35, and platelets of 236,000.  His INR is 1.7. 


In summary, Mr. Thomson is a 65-year-old gentleman with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and an EF of about 25%-30% who is status post CABG in 2000.  He now suffers from diabetic nephropathy and is on peritoneal dialysis for end-stage kidney disease.  He appears to be in New York Heart Association class II by symptoms and has evidence of some volume overload on exam.  This may be because his peritoneal dialysis was delayed today as a consequence of his appointment with us.  His cardiomyopathy clearly predates his renal dysfunction.  Therefore, it is likely that he will continue to have cardiomyopathy, even after renal transplant.  It is also likely that he will require continued diuretic therapy for this in the future.  It is unclear whether he has any ischemia.  We will perform an exercise MIBI to evaluate this further.  I will see him again in 1 month's time to follow up on the MIBI results. 


Please feel free to contact me with any further questions. 


Sincerely,

Shapiro Building 70 Francis Street 

Boston, MA 02115 


Dear Dr. Epstein: 


Russell Mitchell is a 71-year-old retired radiologist who was admitted for biventricular ICD placement and the procedure was aborted due to morning labs showing creatinine elevation to 2.6 and the patient was admitted for more fluid hydration and restoration of stability prior to proceeding to the EP procedure. 


He has a long history of a cardiomyopathy as well was atrial flutter that has been treated with ablation procedures as of a year ago and then repeat ablation on 10/15/14.  After the procedure, which required being n.p.o. for 48 hours beforehand and not receiving much fluids, he was found to have the elevated creatinine.  The procedure was then deferred until restoration of his renal status and he was admitted to the step-down area. 


He has otherwise been relatively stable.  I agree with the full presentation.  History as identified by Dr. Weisberg. 


His past medical history is also notable for hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and migraine headaches.  He has had multiple AF ablations.  He also has a nonischemic cardiomyopathy. 


His medications at home include alfuzosin 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg b.i.d., Depakote 500 mg b.i.d., finasteride 5 mg daily, furosemide 40 mg every other day, losartan 50 mg daily, and Coumadin 2.5 mg daily alternating with 1.25 mg 3 days per week. 


Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.  He is a retired radiologist. 


His review of systems was reviewed in detail and is unremarkable. 


Family history is Noncontributory. 


On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 110/70.  When he first was admitted, his blood pressure was in the range of 98/60.  Head and neck are unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal.  There is S3 or S4.  Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.  Bowel sounds are normal.  Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.  Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.  Distal pulses are normal. 


His electrocardiogram demonstrates left bundle-branch block pattern with normal sinus rhythm. 


His creatinine initially rose as high as 2.7, but it has decreased during hospitalization to 2.0.  His chronic creatinine is in the range of 1.6.  His losartan has been held. 


At this point, we will maintain our supportive management.  If his renal function continues to improve, he will plan for the ICD and CRT on Monday.

ATTENDING: RAYMOND KWONG 


HPI:  

71 yo retired radiologist with PMH of CKD (baseline Cr 1.5) , cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%, NYHA III), LBBB, and afib/flutter s/p AF ablation (July 2013) who presents s/p uncomplicated repeat AT ablation (10/15/14) with AKI. Pre-procedure TEE demonstrated no atrial thrombus and EF of 20-25%. Of note, patient was NPO >48hrs during these procedures and had not been receiving IVF. The procedure proceeded with roof ablation without complication with total fluoroscopy dose 497 mGy. No significant fliuid shifts were noted. After the procedure, the pt noted decreased urine output, and a foley was placed. The patient has a history of urinary retention after anesthesia. This morning the pt was preparing for biventricular ICD placement, and the procedure was aborted when AM labs showed a Cr of 2.57 from 1.68 on the previous day.  


He denies any recent medication changes, or decreased UOP prior to his TEE on 10/15/14. 


The patient initially presented with dyspnea on exertion and decreasing exercise tolerance in March of 2013.  He was found to be in atrial fibrillation and was begun on Pradaxa and verapamil.  He had progressive symptoms and increasing edema and atrial fibrillation.  An EF at that time on echo was 25% or less and a catheterization showed no significant coronary disease.  He underwent a TEE with plans for cardioversion, but was found to have a possible thrombus and therefore was not cardioverted. However, he was started on Multaq at that time.  In addition, he was begun on Coreg and Xarelto.  He had a followup TEE, which was negative and underwent a cardioversion in May.  He underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure by Dr. Marcus Wharton in South Carolina in July of this year complicated by phrenic nerve palsy.  His heart rate remained in the 50-60s jumped back up to the 80s. He was then evaluated by Dr. Epstein and found to be in an atypical atrial flutter with controlled ventricular response in the 80s.  His EF was 24% with a left atrium of 4.6 cm on echo.  When in normal rhythm, his EF was 35-40%.  At that time, he was scheduled for repeat ablation with biventricular ICD placement.

Assessment: 71 yo retired radiologist with PMH of CKD (baseline Cr 1.5) , cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%, NYHA III), LBBB, and afib/flutter s/p AF ablation (July 2013) who presents s/p uncomplicated repeat AT ablation (10/15/14) with AKI. Pre-procedure TEE demonstrated no atrial thrombus and EF of 20-25% 


Plan by Problems: 


#AKI: The pt's AKI is most likely pre-renal due to 48 hours of very little PO intake. Contrast nephropathy usually presents 2-3 days after the dye load, and is thus an unlikely cause of AKI, though it may slow his recovery. Other causes of AKI, including medications, infection, and obstruction are unlikely by history, and exam.   

Dx:  

- Trend UOP, strict I/Os 

- Repeat UA 

- Urine Sed 

- Urine Lytes 

- Urine Protein, Cr 

- Renal US 

- Daily CBC, BMP 

Tx:  

- The pt was encouraged to take PO  

- Will hold further IVF given low EF 


# Hyperkalemia: 

- PM BMP 

- Will hold tx for now 


# CVr: Afib s/p ablation and in NSR, INR goal 2-3 

- Continue Warfarin Sodium PO (2.5mg for  M, T, Th, S, 1.25 mg for Sun Wed Fri)

# CVp: EF 20-25% NYHA III 

- WIll reduce Carvedilol to 6.25mg BID (home dose 25mg BID) due to rates in the 60s, and uptitrate as tolerated 

- Hold Losartan for AKI, plan to resume on discharge 


# Home medications:  

- Cont Alfuzosin, Depakote, Finasteride  


FEN 

- house diet 

- Replete lytes prn 


PPX:  

- Not necessary, on coumadin

CHIEF COMPLAINT: s/p BiV ICD 


HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: 

Mr Hibbard is a 84 yo M with h/o rheumatic heart disease s/p triple valve surgery (MVR (bioprosthetic), AVR (bioprosthetic) and TV annuloplasty with LAA amputation) and PPM placement for CHB in April 2012, chronic AF, pulm HTN, HL, DM who presents s/p BiV ICD.  

Patient had surgery with Dr. Vlahakes in April 2012 including MVR (bioprosthetic), AVR (bioprosthetic) and TV annuloplasty with LAA amputation after which he was noted postoperatively to have CHB requiring pacing with epicardial pacing wires. He underwent PPM placement on 4/30/12. Patient noted SOB with lightheadedness and presyncope worsening since 11/2012. He denies chest pain, palpitations, syncope, PND or orthopnea. Per Melissa McNamara 7/23/13 note pacemaker interrogation on 04/08/2013 showed battery with 10 years, leads WNL. Realtime EGM: AF-VP at 70 bpm. Underneath: AF-VS at 60-95 bpm. VP 35%. HR histogram shows 70 bpm 50% of the time,w ith smaller bell curve for 80-140bpm. Chronic AF, no tachycardia detections. Recent echo 1/30/13 showed EF decreased to 30-35% (from 50-60%). Given EKG with AV dyssynchrony, decreased EF and continued NYHA class II symptoms, patient had CRT-D upgrade after which he was admitted to SDU for further monitoring.

RECENT DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES 

Per Melissa McNamara 7/23/13 note:  

A 24-hour Holter monitor from 5/8/13, showed the average heart rate was 79 bpm. The minimum heart rate was 42 bpm. The maximum heart rate was 141 beats per minute. Ventricular ectopic activity consisted of 51 beats of which 38 were in single PVCs and 13 were in single VEs. The patient's rhythm included 30 minutes 34 seconds of tachycardia. The fastest single episode of tachycardia lasted 2 minutes 4 seconds with a maximum heart rate of 141 beats per minute. The patient had 167 episodes of atrial fibrillation with a total time of 17 hours 38 minutes and 28 seconds representing 75.7% of the total beats. The episode of atrial fibrillation with the fastest ventricular response lasted 12 minutes 12 seconds with a maximum heart rate of 148 beats per minute. The episode of atrial fibrillation with the slowest ventricular response lasted 22 seconds with a minimum heart rate of 59 beats per minute. The episode of atrial fibrillation, the longest duration lasted one hour 43 minutes 58 seconds with a maximum heart rate of 119 beats per minute. Of note, this Holter monitor was done with after an increase of his atenolol to 75 mg a.m. and 50 mg in the evening.

 Reason for visit:
 CRT-D Implant

 Interval History:
 Bob Hibbard was seen recently in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic in consultation for progressive exertional shortness of breath s/p triple valve surgery and PPM placement in April 2012. He is an 83 year-old man with history which includes rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, secondary tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, temporal arteritis and osteoarthritis. On 4/25/2012, he underwent MVR (bioprosthetic), AVR (bioprosthetic) and TV annuloplasty with LAA amputation with Dr. Vlahakes. 

Prior to his cardiac surgery, he had developed progressive exertional dyspnea, fatigue, intermittent exertional chest tightness and lightheadedness with severe bilateral lower leg pain associated with increased shortness of breath when climbing stairs. He was seen in consultation by Dr. Vlahakes on 3/20/2012. It was determined that he would be best served, given the progression of his symptoms impacting his activity level and also possible lower extremity joint replacement surgery in the future by proceeding with mitral valve replacement (bioprosthetic), tricuspid valve repair, left atrial appendage amputation, +/- CABG (based on results of preop cardiac catheterization). Cardiac catheterization demonstrated no significant epicardial coronary artery disease, moderately elevated right heart pressures and 7mmHg peak trans-aortic gradient with AVA 1.7cm2. 

Post operatively, he continued to have complete heart block and was paced via epicardial pacing wires. He underwent PPM placement on 4/30/12. He tolerated the procedure and remained stable. He was discharged on 5/2/12 to rehab. He has since followed up with Dr.Vlahakes in his clinic. Of note, post operatively, an abdominal CT scan revealed that he had a dilated gallbladder without evidence of inflammation. In particular, he was also found to have a side branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in the head of the pancreas. He has since followed by Dr. Lillimoe, who has suggested that he follow up in the spring for another pancreatic protocol CT scan. 

Mr. Hibbard reports that he has been short of breath, mostly with exertion, particularly since November. His dyspnea is occasionally accompanied by lightheadedness and presyncope which resolves after 20 seconds. He does not believe that his dyspnea has improved since his triple valve surgery in April of 2012. He continues to have pain in his legs while climbing stairs. He reports bilateral ankle edema. He denies chest pain, palpitations, or actual syncope. He sleeps well with 1 pillow at night and denies PND or orthopnea. He has remained on Coumadin and his levels have recently been sub therapeutic. He has had some epistaxis for which he went to a local ER and received nasal packing. He has also been referred to Pulmonology at Concord Hospital who advised containing with his current inhalers until after his EP evaluation. 

He has been followed at Laconia Cardiology and had a recent stress-echocardiogram on 1/30/13 which noted an LVEF 30-35%, with "paradoxical/dyssynergic septal motion consistent with post-operative status"and mildly dilated LA 40cm. No evidence of bioprosthetic aortic regurgitation, bioprosthetic MVR is well seated without stenosis with mild mitral insufficiency, trace/mild pulmonic regurgitation. With Standard Bruce protocol the patient was exercised for three minutes, achieving a maximum HR of 142 which is 103% of predicted maximal HR. EKG was un interpretable due to paced rhythm, atrial fibrillation was noted. No 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved workload. Of note, echocardiogram from Laconia Cardiology from 6/13/2012 showed EF between 55-60% with LA 41.7 cm2. 

Pacemaker interrogation on 04/08/2013 showed battery with 10 years,leads WNL. Realtime EGM: AF-VP at 70 bpm. Underneath: AF-VS at 60-95 bpm. VP 35%. HR histogram shows 70 bpm 50% of the time,w ith smaller bell curve for 80-140bpm. Chronic AF, no tachycardia detections.

 Assessment and plan:
 Bob Hibbard is a pleasant 83-year-old gentleman with history of rheumatic heart disease- mixed valvular heart disease, chronic atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin), DM II, and hyperlipidemia. He underwent MVR (bioprosthetic), AVR (bioprosthetic), TV annuloplasty and LAA amputation in 4/25/12 with Dr. Vlahakes with postoperative PPM placement for CHB, now presenting with progressive exertional dyspnea and newly decreased ejection fraction.

Shortness of breath 
NYHA class II symptoms. Dyspnea on exertion could be multifactorial. It could be related to his atrial fibrillation and/or rate control. We will increase his Atenolol to 75mg in the am and 50mg in the evening for better rate control. We will get a 24 hr Holter monitor, which he can have placed locally, to check his heart rate distribution in 1-2 weeks. If his heart rate is still elevated despite an increase in medication, we could consider an AVN ablation which we briefly discussed. Importantly, his EF has decreased from 55% to 30-35% on recent echo. We would like to confirm this by viewing the films and we will attempt to obtain the CD from Loconia Cardiology. If his EF is in fact depressed, we may consider upgrading to a CRT-D, as his EKG exhibits AV dyssynchrony, and he has NYHA class II symptoms.

Atrial fibrillation 
Chronic AF with heart rates occasionally elevated 80-140bpm. We increased Atenolol as above. He is on Coumadin for stroke prevent with CHADS2 score of 4 (age, HTN, DM, CHF).

Permanent pacemaker 
Medtronic generator: battery and leads are WNL. He is followed locally for his PPM follow up.

We have obtained Mr. Hibbard's echocardiogram films for review and he has also had a Holter monitor, which has been faxed to us. The results are as follows:

A 24-hour Holter monitor from 5/8/13, showed the average heart rate was 79 bpm. The minimum heart rate was 42 bpm. The maximum heart rate was 141 beats per minute. Ventricular ectopic activity consisted of 51 beats of which 38 were in single PVCs and 13 were in single VEs. The patient's rhythm included 30 minutes 34 seconds of tachycardia. The fastest single episode of tachycardia lasted 2 minutes 4 seconds with a maximum heart rate of 141 beats per minute. The patient had 167 episodes of atrial fibrillation with a total time of 17 hours 38 minutes and 28 seconds representing 75.7% of the total beats. The episode of atrial fibrillation with the fastest ventricular response lasted 12 minutes 12 seconds with a maximum heart rate of 148 beats per minute. The episode of atrial fibrillation with the slowest ventricular response lasted 22 seconds with a minimum heart rate of 59 beats per minute. The episode of atrial fibrillation, the longest duration lasted one hour 43 minutes 58 seconds with a maximum heart rate of 119 beats per minute. Of note, this Holter monitor was done with after an increase of his atenolol to 75 mg a.m. and 50 mg in the evening.

We obtained the films from his echocardiogram from January 30, 2013, which showed an EF of 30-35%, which had decreased from EF 55% on prior echo. Dr. Singh was able to review the CD from Laconia Cardiology and EF is in fact depressed as noted.

Given that his ejection fraction is decreased to 30-35%, his EKG exhibits AV dyssynchrony, and he continues to have New York Heart Association class II symptoms, we will pursue a CRT-D upgrade. During his hospitalization for CRT-D, we will likely adjust his medical regimen for better rate control for his atrial fibrillation. The option of AV nodal ablation has come up in the past; however, we would like to pursue adjusting his medical regimen prior to pursuing AV nodal ablation in a staged approach. Mr. Hibbard reports that he continues to be short of breath and his symptoms really have not improved since we last saw him in April of this year. We have planned for his CRT-D for 7/23/13. We have sent pre-op testing information to he and his wife in New Hampshire. He will stop his Coumadin two days prior to the procedure per Dr. Singh with goal INR 2.0 on the day of the procedure. I have spoken with Alex at the Darthmouth Hitchcock Coumadin clinic regarding these instructiions. We will have an INR drawn on 7/22/13 while he is here for an appointment with Dr. Lilliemoe.

Visit Note 


Patient Name:  HIBBARD, BOB                       MRN:  5123007 

Dictated Date:  07/22/2013                        Dictated by:  Keith D. Lillemoe, M.D. 


Date of Visit:  07/22/2013 

REASON FOR VISIT: Followup for likely IPMN in the head of the pancreas.  


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 84 year old male who underwent a complicated cardiac procedure Dr. Vlahakes in April 2002. Postoperatively, he had some abdominal pain and distention. A CT scan was obtained. This scan showed an incidental finding of a 1.5 cm cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas consistent with a side branch IPMN. After an uneventful recovery the patient had some issues with a fall and some broken ribs, but other then that really had no problems that could be attributable to this likely cystic neoplasm. I saw him in November 2012 at which time with careful history without any symptoms to suggest that there was an indication for surgery. Furthermore, the cystic lesion was about 1.5 cm, benign-appearing with no mural nodule and no pancreatic ductal dilatation. It was my advice that he be seen in followup in roughly a year's time after the scan to look for any change.  


On history he continues to note no symptoms suggestion of pancreatic disease. Specifically he has no abdominal pain, no weight gain, weight loss. No evidence of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with his bowels moving regularly. He has not developed jaundice. No history of pancreatitis. He denies to back pain. His main issue remains his heart. He is being seen tomorrow in the cardiac physiology laboratory to perhaps undergo some form of coordination of his pacemaker because currently he appears to have some degree of atrial ventricular dissociation due to his atrial fibrillation. He is symptomatic with shortness of breath on exertion which has been worse with the recent heat and humidity. Going up stairs causes significant shortness of breath, but he denies chest pain and overall his heart and valve replacements both seem to be functioning reasonably well.  


I reviewed his medication list. There have been no changes. He continues to be on Coumadin as well as Lasix, atenolol as well as diabetic medications. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He overall looks well. His blood pressure is 147/72. His pulse is 54 and irregular. His temperature is 98.8. Head and neck shows no scleral icterus. No supraclavicular or cervical adenopathy. His chest shows some expiratory wheezes, worse on the left than the right. There is no rales or rhonchi. His cardiac exam shows an irregularly irregular rhythm. He has a harsh systolic murmur. His abdomen is soft, nontender. No palpable mass, no organomegaly, no ascites. His extremities show no peripheral edema.  


STUDIES: Earlier today, the patient had a repeat CT scan. Because of his pacemaker MR was not possible to be done, so we went with another CT scan. The official report is not back, but the lesion appears to be an elongated thin lesion, which may be 2 cm in maximal length. I await the final read from our radiologists, but it still would seem to fall below the criteria where we would consider even enough risk to undergo surgery. For this reason, I do not think we will even plan to do an EUS and endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspirate, particularly while on anticoagulation.  


IMPRESSION: Overall, the patient continues to have an asymptomatic incidental finding of a small intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm that does reach the Sendai criteria for surgical resection. We will probably best to see him in followup in another year's time, but I will make that decision based on the formal read from our radiologist. If it is totally unchanged, we could wait almost 2 years before he gets reevaluated.

 Interval History:
 We have obtained Mr. Hibbard's echocardiogram films for review and he has also had a Holter monitor, which has been faxed to us. The results are as follows:

A 24-hour Holter monitor from May 8, 2013, showed the average heart rate was 79 beats per minute. The minimum heart rate was 42 beats per minute. The maximum heart rate was 141 beats per minute. Ventricular ectopic activity consisted of 51 beats of which 38 were in single PVCs and 13 were in single VEs. The patient's rhythm included 30 minutes 34 seconds of tachycardia. The fastest single episode of tachycardia lasted 2 minutes 4 seconds with a maximum heart rate of 141 beats per minute. The patient had 167 episodes of atrial fibrillation with a total time of 17 hours 38 minutes and 28 seconds representing 75.7% of the total beats. The episode of atrial fibrillation with the fastest ventricular response lasted 12 minutes 12 seconds with a maximum heart rate of 148 beats per minute. The episode of atrial fibrillation with the slowest ventricular response lasted 22 seconds with a minimum heart rate of 59 beats per minute. The episode of atrial fibrillation, the longest duration lasted one hour 43 minutes 58 seconds with a maximum heart rate of 119 beats per minute. Of note, this Holter monitor was done with after an increase of his atenolol to 75 mg a.m. and 50 mg in the evening.

We obtained the films from his echocardiogram from January 30, 2013, which showed an EF of 30-35%, which had decreased from 55% prior. Dr. Singh was able to review the CD from Laconia Cardiology and EF is in fact depressed as noted.

Given that his ejection fraction is decreased 30-35%, his EKG exhibits AV dyssynchrony, and he continues to have New York Heart Association class II symptoms, we will pursue a CRT-D upgrade. During his hospitalization for CRT-D, we will likely adjust his medical regimen for better rate control for his atrial fibrillation. The option of AV nodal ablation has come up in the past; however, we would like to pursue adjusting his medical regimen prior to pursuing AV nodal ablation with a staged approach. Mr. Hibbard reports that he continues to be short of breath and his symptoms really have not improved since we last saw him in April of this year. We will plan for his CRT-D for 7/23/13. We will send preop testing information to he and his wife in New Hampshire. He will stop his Coumadin two days prior to the procedure per Dr. Singh with goal INR 2.0 on the day of the procedure. I have spoken with Alex at the Darthmouth Hitchcock Coumadin clinic regarding these instructiions. We will have an INR drawn on 7/22/13 while he is here for another appointment with Dr. Lilliemoe.

CC: s/p ICD placement 


HPI:  Mr. Longtin is a 51 year old gentleman with a longstanding history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 32%), DM, HTN and HLD admitted s/p BiV-ICD placement.  Mr. Longtin was admitted in NH 6/2012 for CHF exacerbation in the setting of excessive EtOH intake; at that time was found to have EF 20-25% and PCWP 26 mmHg.  TSH, iron studies, HIV normal.  Since then, his EF has not improved significantly (32% most recently), though has been able to play golf and walk on the treadmill.  Given low EF, LBBB and evidence of dyssynchrony on TTE, he was referred for CRT-D implantation.  


Reports that he has been feeling well recently other than mild congestion, sometimes w/associated cough worst in the am that he attributes to allergies.  Has had no CP, SOB, or any other sx. 


Today underwent Bi-V ICD placement via axillary approach.  There were no reported complications.  There was concern for increased somnolence and recommendation that he see his PCP after discharge for consideration of a sleep study.

 Reason for visit:
 BiV ICD implant

 Interval History:
 Mr. Joseph Longtin is a very pleasant 51 year old gentleman with a longstanding history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with a low ejection fraction. He has had a longstanding history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, and apparently was hospitalized at an outside hospital with acute systolic failure in June of 2012. Apparently this episode was preceded by heavy alcohol consumption. His ejection fraction at that point in time showed an EF of 20-25%. Subsequent to this he stopped consuming alcohol and there was apparently an improvement in his ejection fraction, somewhere around 35%. However, he saw me recently for evaluation for resynchronization therapy since the most recent echocardiogram shows an EF of 32%. 

Mr. Longtin feels well and does not complain of any chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, or fainting. He does have exertional shortness of breath and appears to be NYHA Class II. He works out on a treadmill and has been playing golf but his overall effort tolerance has diminished in the recent past. Interestingly, his EKG also shows a left bundle branch block pattern and this shows that he has a normal axis with a left bundle with a QRS duration of 154 msec.

 Past medical history:
 1) Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy 
2) Left bundle branch block 
3) Diabetes 
4) Hypertension 
5) Hyperlipidemia

 Changes to Allergies 
NKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: [reviewed]

 Family history 
 - No history of cardiomyopathy, coronary disease, or sudden cardiac death. 
- Four brothers are all healthy.

 Social history:
 Lives in Lowell with his wife and 2 children. Currently works as a bartender at the East End Club. 

Physical examination: 
-General: He is comfortable in the sitting position. Afebrile.
-HEENT: Benign.
-Neck: JVP is not raised.
-Chest: Lungs clear to auscultation.
-Cardiac: First and second heart sound of normal intensity. The second heart sound is paradoxically split. Soft systolic murmur at the base of the heart.
-Neuro: Intact.
-Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. 2+ pedal pulses.


Vital Signs: weight 232 lb
  Pulse 73 bpm
  BMI 32.4 Obese, high risk. 
  height 71 in
  BP 100/70 mmHg

 EKG:
 01/14/2013: Left bundle branch block with normal sinus rhythm. QRS duration - 154 msec. QTc - 495 msec. Left axis is at -2.

 Assessment and plan:
 Mr. Longtin is a very pleasant 51 year old gentleman with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. In terms of cardiomyopathy, it is clearly evident that he has a dyssynchronously contracting left ventricle in the setting of left bundle branch block. He also has a low ejection fraction. The contribution of alcohol to his cardiomyopathy is unclear, however, on account of the presence of the interventricular conduction defect I do feel that his ejection fraction is not going to improve a whole lot after complete stopping of his alcohol intake. He is on a good medical regimen and I think this should continue, however, he meets all the appropriate criteria for cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator. I have explained this in detail to him and his wife. We talked at length about the mechanisms of dyssynchrony and cardiac remodeling. We talked about the procedure and all the potential risks. They understand the risk/benefit ratio and after mulling over the facts wish to proceed with resynchronization therapy.

HPI:Mr. Darsch is a 63 yo w/ history MI in 1994 w/ ischemic cardiomyopathy, CABG, mechanical St. Jude aortic valve replacement in 1999, DM type I and chronic kidney disease on PD who now presents s/p cardiac arrest. According to his wife he was in the car with her when he suddenly became unresponsive, slumped over and eyes rolled back in his head. She noted him to be apneic and pulseless. They were near Jordan hospital, so she brought him there where CPR was initiated with return of pulses spontaneously without any medication administration. He then woke up, was speaking, but had onset of copious vomiting so was intubated for airway protection. He then went into a wide, irregular rhythm and was apparently hypotensive so was cardioverted with resolution but then reverted to AF. EMS was called and apparently after getting a dose of Lopressor for tachycardia he became bradycardic, hypotensive and required trans-cutaneous pacing. He currently arrives paced, with stable vitals on 10 mcg/kg/min of Dopa and on Propofol. [mae17]

In 1995 (age 52) he presented with chest pressure (felt like "heartburn") and NSTEMI. Coronary angiography at BWH revealed 3-vessel disease and he underwent CABG (LIMA-D2, SVG-LAD, SVG-RCA). In 2003, he underwent angiography at MGH after he presented with chest pain and ETT MIBI revealed large anterior scar with anterobasal ischemia, LVEF 24%. Bypass graft angiography revealed LIMA-D2, SVG-LAD, and SVG-RCA were all patent. However, native D2 (anterior branch) had 90% proximal stenosis that was treated with bare metal stent (2.25 x 13mm). Persantine MIBI in October 2009 revealed anterior-apical and inferioposterior scar without significant ischemia. TTE in July 2011 reports LVEF 20%, LVIDd 80 mm. LVEF has been in the 20% range since his MI and he had a dual chamber Medtronic ICD placed in 2009. Echo in 2011 also reports moderate to severe MR, dilated LA. Mild TR, estimated RVSP 58 mmHg. RV dilation and hypokinesis. LVIDd reported at 72 mm in 2009. 

He had a TTE on 4/2013 which reports LVEF 11%, LVIDd 71 mm. Diffuse HK with regional variation. No thrombus. Moderate-severe MR. LA 49 mm. No AS. Mild TR, estimated RVSP 67 mmHg. RV hypokinetic. 

He has lost 40-50lbs unintentionally over the past few years, mainly due to decreased appetite. He has been worked up extensively for his weight loss and all testing has been within normal limits. He reports that gradually he has been feeling more frequent episodes of shortness of breath. He does not do much physical activity, but while walking he finds himself needing to rest for a few minutes. He feels that some of his difficulty walking is related to his chronic hip pain. He has dyspnea if he walks quickly and when he needs to walk up a second flight of stairs. He denies chest pain or palpitations. He has occasional postural dizziness. He has not had any presyncope or syncope. He denies lower extremity swelling, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

 Reason for visit:
 Upgrade to dual-chamber BiV ICD system

 Interval History:
 Mr. Leslie Uliss is a pleasant 69 year old male with a history CABG in 1995, ischemic cardiomyopathy, (EF 11% by recent echo), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and peripheral arterial disease (status post bilateral iliac artery stenting in 2002 at an outside hospital) who presents in long term follow up. He was last seen in 2009 by Dr, Singh for enrollment in the Optivol study. He was previously followed by Dr. John Levinson and is now followed by Dr. Weiner in Cardiology. He was being referred to Dr. Singh for evaluation for CRT-D upgrade. 

I will review his cardiac history for our records. In 1995 (age 52) he presented with chest pressure (felt like "heartburn") and NSTEMI. Coronary angiography at BWH revealed 3-vessel disease and he underwent CABG (LIMA-D2, SVG-LAD, SVG-RCA). In 2003, he underwent angiography at MGH after he presented with chest pain and ETT MIBI revealed large anterior scar with anterobasal ischemia, LVEF 24%. Bypass graft angiography revealed LIMA-D2, SVG-LAD, and SVG-RCA were all patent. However, native D2 (anterior branch) had 90% proximal stenosis that was treated with bare metal stent (2.25 x 13mm). Persantine MIBI in October 2009 revealed anterior-apical and inferioposterior scar without significant ischemia. TTE in July 2011 reports LVEF 20%, LVIDd 80 mm. LVEF has been in the 20% range since his MI and he had a dual chamber Medtronic ICD placed in 2009. Echo in 2011 also reports moderate to severe MR, dilated LA. Mild TR, estimated RVSP 58 mmHg. RV dilation and hypokinesis. LVIDd reported at 72 mm in 2009. 

He had a TTE on 4/2013 which reports LVEF 11%, LVIDd 71 mm. Diffuse HK with regional variation. No thrombus. Moderate-severe MR. LA 49 mm. No AS. Mild TR, estimated RVSP 67 mmHg. RV hypokinetic. 

He has lost 40-50lbs unintentionally over the past few years, mainly due to decreased appetite. He reports he has been worked up extensively for his weight loss and all testing has been within normal limits. He reports that gradually he has been feeling more frequent episodes of shortness of breath. He does not do much physical activity, but while walking he finds himself needing to rest for a few minutes. He feels that some of his difficulty walking is related to his chronic hip pain. He has dyspnea if he walks quickly and when he needs to walk up a second flight of stairs. He denies chest pain or palpitations. He has occasional postural dizziness. He has not had any presyncope or syncope. He denies lower extremity swelling, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He has a girlfriend who lives in the same apartment building. He uses Viagra and tolerates it.

 Assessment and plan:
 Leslie Uliss is a lovely 69-year-old male patient with CAD s/p CABG (1995) and BMS to native diagonal in 2003, ischemic cardiomyopathy with MR, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive sleep apnea who presented for evaluation for upgrade to CRT.

Ischemic cardiomyopathy 
LVEF previously 20%, and was more recently 11% by TTE. Dual chamber ICD placed in 2009. He has NYHA class II symptoms with wide QRS (182ms) with LBBB on EKG. We would recommend a BIV upgrade which we can plan at Mr. Uliss' soonest convenience. We discussed the procedure for BIV upgrade at length. First we will perform a venogram to assess his vasculature to implant the additional lead. If he has patent vasculature, we can use his left side and if occluded we will tunnel from the right. We explained the risks of the procedure, the need to stay in the hospital overnight after the procedure, and follow-up in the CRT clinic. He wishes to proceed. He continues medical therapy with Diovan 160 mg daily and Digoxin 0.125 mg daily. He has reportedly been unable to tolerate a beta blocker due to reactive airway disease. He continues Lasix 40 mg daily and spironolactone 25 mg daily. We also spoke with him about enrolling in the DIRECT study prior to his upgrade. He is interested and our research coordinators will be in touch with him.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillator 
Medtronic SECURA DR (2009). Carelink transition 4/17/13 showed no VT/VF detects since implant, auto capture on. Real-time EGM shows AS-VS @ 70bpm. Heart rate histogram w/good distribution. Patient activity 4.8hr/day. All other ICD measurements were within normal limits. AS-VS 59.2% AP-VS 40.7%. 

Habits/Risk Screening: 
Drug use status: none 
Alcohol use status: none/minimal 
Smoking status: former smoker Quit 1995
Activity level: moderate Limited secondary to his hip pain.

RE: Evaluation for BIV upgrade: ischemic cardiomyopathy

Dear Drs. Finn and Weiner:

 Dr. Singh and I had the pleasure of seeing Leslie Uliss in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic at the Massachusetts General Hospital today. He is a pleasant 69 year old male with a history CABG in 1995, ischemic cardiomyopathy, (EF 11% by recent echo), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and peripheral arterial disease (status post bilateral iliac artery stenting in 2002 at an outside hospital) who presents in long term follow up. He was last seen in 2009 by Dr, Singh for enrollment in the Optivol study. He was previously followed by Dr. John Levinson and is now followed by Dr. Weiner in Cardiology. He is being referred to Dr. Singh today for evaluation for CRT-D upgrade. 

I will review his cardiac history for our records. In 1995 (age 52) he presented with chest pressure (felt like "heartburn") and NSTEMI. Coronary angiography at BWH revealed 3-vessel disease and he underwent CABG (LIMA-D2, SVG-LAD, SVG-RCA). In 2003, he underwent angiography at MGH after he presented with chest pain and ETT MIBI revealed large anterior scar with anterobasal ischemia, LVEF 24%. Bypass graft angiography revealed LIMA-D2, SVG-LAD, and SVG-RCA were all patent. However, native D2 (anterior branch) had 90% proximal stenosis that was treated with bare metal stent (2.25 x 13mm). Persantine MIBI in October 2009 revealed anterior-apical and inferioposterior scar without significant ischemia. TTE in July 2011 reports LVEF 20%, LVIDd 80 mm. LVEF has been in the 20% range since his MI and he had a dual chamber Medtronic ICD placed in 2009. Echo in 2011 also reports moderate to severe MR, dilated LA. Mild TR, estimated RVSP 58 mmHg. RV dilation and hypokinesis. LVIDd reported at 72 mm in 2009. 

He had a TTE on 4/2013 which reports LVEF 11%, LVIDd 71 mm. Diffuse HK with regional variation. No thrombus. Moderate-severe MR. LA 49 mm. No AS. Mild TR, estimated RVSP 67 mmHg. RV hypokinetic. 

He has lost 40-50lbs unintentionally over the past few years, mainly due to decreased appetite. He reports he has been worked up extensively for his weight loss and all testing has been within normal limits. He reports that gradually he has been feeling more frequent episodes of shortness of breath. He does not do much physical activity, but while walking he finds himself needing to rest for a few minutes. He feels that some of his difficulty walking is related to his chronic hip pain. He has dyspnea if he walks quickly and when he needs to walk up a second flight of stairs. He denies chest pain or palpitations. He has occasional postural dizziness. He has not had any presyncope or syncope. He denies lower extremity swelling, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He has a girlfriend who lives in the same apartment building. He uses Viagra and tolerates it.

 Assessment and plan:
 Leslie Uliss is a lovely 69-year-old male patient with CAD s/p CABG (1995) and BMS to native diagonal in 2003, ischemic cardiomyopathy with MR, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive sleep apnea who presents today for evaluation for upgrade to CRT.

Assessment and Plan: 
Ischemic cardiomyopathy - LVEF previously 20%, and was more recently 11% by TTE. Dual chamber ICD placed in 2009. He has NYHA class II symptoms with wide QRS (182ms) with LBBB on EKG. We would recommend a BIV upgrade which we can plan at Mr. Uliss' soonest convenience. Today we discussed the procedure for BIV upgrade at length. First we will perform a venogram to assess his vasculature to implant the additional lead. If he has patent vasculature, we can use his left side and if occluded we will tunnel from the right. We explained the risks of the procedure, the need to stay in the hospital overnight after the procedure, and follow-up in the CRT clinic. He wishes to proceed and we will plan for his procedure in July as he has a trip planned for June. He continues medical therapy with Diovan 160 mg daily and Digoxin 0.125 mg daily. He has reportedly been unable to tolerate a beta blocker due to reactive airway disease. He continues Lasix 40 mg daily and spironolactone 25 mg daily. We also spoke with him today about enrolling in the DIRECT study prior to his upgrade. He is interested and our research coordinators will be in touch with him.
.
Implantable cardioverter defibrillator . - Medtronic SECURA DR (2009). Carelink transition 4/17/13 showed no VT/VF detects since implant, auto capture on. Real-time EGM shows AS-VS @ 70bpm.

 Other Data:
 TTE (11/2008): mild to moderate MR. The left ventricular cavity size is dilated, LVID 68 mm with LV diffusely hypokinetic with regional variation, focal wall thinning and akinesis of the inferior wall suggesting a left ventricular scar, EF 24%. LAE 51 mm. RVSP 29mmHg. 

PFT 4/2010: mild obstructive ventilatory deficit with reduced FVC. 

 Assessment and plan:
 Mr. Bakunowicz is a 59M with ischemic cardiomyopathy, NSVT (last detection was 2009 for PMVT with ICD shock) and permanent atrial fibrillation since 2007 with dual chamber ICD. Most recent EF is 24% from 11/2008 and pending repeat. He is currently NYHA FC II heart failure symptoms with optimal medical management and diuretic titration 5/2011. He is ~ 80% ventricularly paced with lower pacing rate set at 60 bpm. 

Most of our visit focused on the upgrade procedure from dual chamber ICD to CRT-D. We discussed the risk and outcomes of adding the LV lead and he had his questions answered. He agreed to proceed and consent was signed. He will need a repeat Echocardiogram sooner than 3/20/12 so that will be rescheduled. He will return for preprocedure labs and CXR at that time. He will HOLD Coumadin and Metformin for 2 days prior to. His CRT-D upgrade will be scheduled with Dr. Mela in the ensuing weeks. He will not need DFT testing, since he will be off his Coumadin and has been in permanent atrial fibrillation since 2007. He will be referred to CRT Clinic after upgrade. We will follow up with him with ICD once CRT Clinic has been completed.

 Reason for visit:
 ERI, consider upgrade from single ICD to CRT-D

 Interval History:
 Dr. Mela and I had the pleasure of seeing Bronislaw "Roni" Bakunowicz, a 59M in long-term follow up at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic today. He has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy status post a large inferoposterior myocardial infarction in July of 2000 complicated by AV block and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. He underwent implantation of a dual-chamber ICD 8/2000 with ICD generator change 11/2006. His most recent Echocardiogram was 11/2008 that demonstrated EF 25% with LAE 51 mm and LVID 68 mm. PFTs show mild obstructive disease. 

At his most recent ICD interrogation 12/27/11 his device triggered ERI. He is in chronic atrial fibrillation with dual chamber device. His most recent VT detection was in November 2009 for polymorphic VT with successful ICD shock. 

Over the past year, he has reported increased shortness of breath, particularly during shoveling snow last winter. His Lasix dose was increased 5/2011 but has not had any HF admissions. He reports feeling better, able to now go up and down stairs with less SOB and can walk long-distance on a flat surface without difficulty. His medications have been optimized with the addition of aldactone a few months back as directed by cardiologist Dr. Abtahian. He is also on ACE, beta-blocker, digoxin and diuretic. His home weight has been stable 245lbs at home.

Your clotting function tests were as expected. Your blood count tests, basic chemistry tests and liver function tests were stable. 

Your total cholesterol was 189. Your HDL (good cholesterol) was 51 (optimal is 40 or greater). Your LDL (bad cholesterol) was 117 (optimal is 70 or less). Your triglycerides were 107 (optimal is 150 or less). 

Your recent hemoglobin A1c was 7.30%, which corresponds to an average blood sugar of approximately 163, indicating that your recent blood sugar has been running slightly high. The hemoglobin A1c goal for most people with diabetes is less than 7.0%. To improve your diabetes control, I would like to increase your metformin to 1000mg twice a day. 

To help you manage your medications, I have included with this letter a list of the medicines I have prescribed for you, and directions on when to take them each day. If this list of medicines looks different than the medicines you are currently taking, please let me know.

Reason for visit: 

 Replacement of EOL Pacemaker/ICD 


Interval History: 

 I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Smith today during his follow up visit in the MGH ICD clinic. As you know, Mr. Smith is a 60 year old gentleman with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who had a dual-chamber CD placed in 1998 for prophylactic purposes. However, he has never sustained a VT event and it is been debated whether or not he needs to have the device replaced. A most recent echocardiogram (02/04/2006) showed a LVEF of 15% and Mr. Smith now agrees to replace the ICD. 


Mr. Smith also present with asymptomatic atrial fibrillation of unknown duration and he has been kept on coumadin because of that. His las INR (2/7/06) was 3.1. The ventricular rate is slow varying from 40 to 56 bpm (EKG). His current medications are: 20 mg of furosemide, 50 mg of spironolactone, 81 mg of aspirin, 5 mg of warfarin, 0.25 digitek, 50 mg of carvedilol and 75 mg of captopril per day. apart from that, he has experienced shortness of breath when he tries to walk faster. 


Past medical history: 

 Dilated CM with congestive heart failure 

Severe childhood asthma, now apparently resolved 

Alcohol abuse in the past 


Selected recent labs: 

Echocardiogram 2/04/2006 showed: 1) The left atrium is dilated. The antero-posterior left atrial dimension is 50 mm. The medial-lateral left atrial dimension is 52 mm. There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis. There is evidence of trace aortic insufficiency by color and spectral Doppler. The ascending aorta diameter above the sinotubular junction is 35 mm (normal <36mm). 2) The left ventricular cavity size is dilated. The left ventricular systolic function is impaired. The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic. There is no evidence of left ventricular thrombus. The transmitral Doppler pattern is 'restrictive' suggesting elevated LA pressure and/or a non-compliant LV. The estimated ejection fraction is 15 %. 3) There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of severe tricuspid insufficiency. There is flow reversal in the hepatic veins detected by Doppler c/w severe TR. There is right atrial dilatation. There is a pacemaker wire noted in the right heart. The inferior vena cava is dilated. The superior-inferior RA dimension is 68 mm. The medial-lateral right atrial dimension is 46 mm.  


Compared to the report of 10/16/1998, there is no important change.  


Impression: 

 Mr. Smith has been lost to follow-up since 3/4/03 but now is trying to get back on track. His dual chamber ICD has been at EOL since 8/14/2004. Presently, charge time is 27 secs with cumulative charge time of 9 min 38 secs. Mr. Smith LVEF is 15%, making him a candidate for replacement of his prophylactic ICD. He now agrees and wants to proceed with that. His procedure has been schedule for February 17th, 2006. 


Given his low heart rate during AF, he is very likely to be RV paced most of the time which could impair his LV function dramatically. More recently, he has experienced shorthness of breath when he tries to walk faster. He was then offered a BiV-ICD to prevent further deterioration on LV function. Defibrillation threshold will not be tested during implantation. He will be kept on coumadin after the procedure and will be re-evaluated in 6 weeks when defibrillation thresholds will be tested and AF possibility cardioverted to sinus rhythm.

There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis.  The aortic valve is 

tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral 

Doppler.  The aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva is 27 mm (normal: less 

than 40mm).  The ascending aorta diameter above the sinotubular junction is 24 

mm (normal: less than or equal to 36mm). 


LEFT VENTRICLE                                                                   

The left ventricular cavity size is dilated.  The left ventricular systolic 

function is severely impaired.  The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic 

with regional variation.  The LV end-diastolic volume is 245 cc.  The LV end 

systolic volume is 203 cc.  There is no evidence of left ventricular thrombus.  

The transmitral Doppler pattern is 'restrictive' suggesting elevated LA 

pressure and/or a non-compliant LV.  The estimated ejection fraction is 15 %.  

LVEF was measured by the single dimension method. 


TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC                                                       

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of moderate tricuspid 

insufficiency.  There is incomplete tricuspid valve closure.  There is right 

atrial dilatation.  There are pacemaker wires noted in the right heart.  The 

superior-inferior RA dimension is 61 mm (normal range: up to 49 mm).  The 

medial-lateral RA dimension is 48 mm (normal range up to 46 mm). 


PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A.                                                   

There is evidence of trace pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral 

Doppler.  The RV systolic pressure was estimated from the regurgitant tricuspid 

velocity  (assuming an RA pressure of 10mmHg).  The estimated RV systolic 

pressure is 61 mmHg. 


RIGHT VENTRICLE                                                                  

The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricle is mildly diffusely 

hypokinetic. 


INTERATRIAL SEPTUM, INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM                                      

The IAS is stretched and displaced to the right c/w an LA volume overload. 


PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES                                      

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion. 


DYSSYNCHRONY                                                                     

Preliminary dyssynchrony analysis: ***Mechanical dyssynchrony was assessed 

using spectral and tissue Doppler imaging.  These indices may predict response 

to CRT but are currently not included among recommended selection criteria for 

CRT (NYHA class 3 or 4, QRS greater than 120ms, LVEF less than 35%)

Age 50-75 years: 0-900 pg/ml 
Age >75 years: 0-1800 pg/ml 

Among patients with dyspnea, NT-proBNP is highly sensitive for the detection 
of acute congestive heart failure. In addition, a NT-proBNP <300 pg/ml 
effectively fules out acute congestive heart failure, with 99% negative 
predictive value. 

Knowledge of each individual patient's NT-proBNP range may be more useful 
than using similar cut-points for every patient. 

Marked elevations in NT-proBNP levels may be observed in states other than 
left ventricular congestive heart failure, including: acute coronary 
syndromes, right heart strain/failure (including pulmonary embolism and cor 
pulmonae), critical illness, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, as well as 
advanced age. 

Falsely low NT-proBNP in congestive heart failure patients may be observed 
with increasing body-mass index.

 Other Data:
 The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram on October 28th, which I have reviewed. Her LVEF is reported at 14%, and the function does appear slightly worse from previous and overall dyssynchronous. She has moderate MR, due to functional MR from LV chamber geometry distortion. Additionally, the degee of TR is increased (moderate) and the estimated RVSP is 54 mmHg. This was reviewed with the patient over the telephone.

She continues Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 5mg daily, she has not been able to tolerate higher doses due to her systemic blood pressure. She continues Lasix 40mg bid (alternating with qd). Her symptoms are Class II-III, so we can plan to add spironolactone in the near future. Additionally, given her LBBB and wide QRS duration (>150 ms) I will refer her to EP for the possibility of a device upgrade to a CRT device.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 Ms. Mwangi returns for followup of her non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and increased shortness of breath.

 Interval History:
 49-year-old African woman with HIV and presumed HIV-associated cardiomyopathy whom initially presented in October 2006 with atypical chest pain and was found to have a left bundle branch block on 12-lead ECG. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed LVEF 30% with diffuse hypokinesis and regional variation (posterior-lateral wall best preserved). LVIDd 53mm. Trace MR and no left atrial dilatation. RV size and function preserved. 

Given her cardiomyopathy and absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the leading diagnosis was HIV associated cardiomyopathy (or idiopathic). Given the low clinical suspicion for CAD, a coronary CT-A was performed and there was no evidence of coronary stenoses. The distal LCx and LAD were not visualized well due to artifiact, but it was unlikely that disease in those areas could explain her global cardiomyopathy. 

She has been treated with a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor. Her LVEF remained in the 24 - 26% range on these agents. We had discussed the role of a primary prevention ICD and she was initially hesitant. She ultimately elected to proceed with this procedure and had a dual chamber ICD implanted by Dr. Stephan Danik in June 2010. Her most recent echocardiogram at that time showed LVEF in the 20% range. Moderate mitral regurgitation was noted (this was mild in 2008). RV dysfunction was noted for the first time.

I last saw the patient in August and at that time she was reporting increased lower extremity swelling, dyspnea and the presence of orthopnea. Although she had previously been off Lasix for some time, she had restarted 20 mg and at the August visit the dose was increased to 40 mg daily. There was no clear precipitant to her increase in congestive symptoms.

In late September, the patient called me and reported lightheadedness. I therefore asked her to hold Lasix for 2 days. She had labs rechecked. Her NT proBNP was elevated to 2100 (from 900 the month before). Her BUN and creatinine were stable and normal. I therefore asked her to resume 40 mg daily of Lasix. Once restarting Lasix, the patient felt that she was feeling better. However, last week she was seen by her infectious disease doctor and she was reporting increased lower extremity swelling and dyspnea. Her blood pressure was 111/79 mmHg and her heart rate was 109 at that visit. I spoke with the patient on the telephone and she increased Lasix to 40 mg twice per day and after doing that she has noted improvement in her breathing and decreased lower extremity swelling.

Today the patient reports that she is feeling improved. The orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea that she was experiencing over the past few weeks has resolved since increasing the Lasix dose. Yesterday, she did experience an episode of lightheadedness and thought she was going to possibly pass out, however this did not happen. After she sat down she felt better. She states that she feels she may have had lower extremity swelling for longer than we initially thought, however she did not pay much attention to it. She states that she does not eat very salty foods and reports compliance with her medications. She has not had chest pain.

 Assessment and plan:
 49-year-old African woman with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (likely HIV associated versus idiopathic) status post dual chamber ICD for primary prevention in June 2010 who continues to experience orthopnea and increased dyspnea on exertion, although this is now improving with the increased Lasix dose.

1) Cardiomyopathy: As detailed above, ischemic work up was unrevealing and presumed etiology is dilated cardiomyopathy associated with HIV infection. Despite HAART and CD4 count increase (> 600) and continuation of ACE/BB her LVEF did not improve. She underwent primary prevention ICD placement in 2010 (no CRT device given her relative lack of symptoms at the time). She had mainly been New York Heart Association Class I symptomatology, however as above she has now continues to experience increasing dyspnea.

There are no clear precipitants to this volume overload and symptoms of heart failure. Specifically, no dietary or medication noncompliance issues. No symptoms to suggest angina or obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease. Her infectious issues appear well managed. Her last echocardiogram showed moderate mitral regurgitation, which has increased from mild over time. Additionally, RV function was noted to be impaired. She needs a repeat echocardiogram to do her change in clinical status, and this is scheduled for November 16. I have contacted the echo lab about the possibility of moving this study up. Her hematocrit is 35, where it had been 39 previously, but this degree of anemia is unlikely to contribute to this exacerbation.

Her physical exam reveals that she is well compensated today, her jugular venous pressure is elevated, but otherwise there is no major signs of volume overload.

She has been responding well to 40 mg of Lasix twice per day, however yesterday she did have a lightheaded episode. Our plan will be for her to alternate 40 mg twice per day and 40 mg daily. It is unclear, as above, as to why she has this increased diuretic requirement. 

She continues Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10 mg daily. Ideally, these doses would be increased however her systolic blood pressure in the 90 mmHg range limits this. Hopefully in the future, as she returns to a euvolemic state we will be able to up titrate the medications. If her symptoms persist, we could consider an upgrade to biventricular device although the goal would be to first understand the mechanism for her increased diuretic requirement.

She has a slightly elevated ALT/AST, which has been present before, and may be due to hepatic congestion.

She will have electrolytes and NT proBNP rechecked today.

2) Primary prevention: Lipids in July 2011 showed LDL 94, HDL 58. The LDL is improved from her previous value of 133 in July 2010. A reasonable LDL target is 100-130.

Presenting Issues: 

Pt brought in several letters from Mass He lath, changing her coverage to Family Assistance with co-pays.  SW unsure, as Pt is not currently working, how this was determined.  Pt has one more letter at home, she will bring and we will meet again next week.   


Long discussion around Pt's functioning.  Pt has been short of breath, on and off, for several months.  States that she feels worse today that when she was originally admitted to MGH 6 years ago.  Some days she just needs to sit in one spot and not move, due to her SOB.  This is very unlike Pt, who is normally quite active.  Pt has appt in ID today.   


Assessment:  49 year-old, single mother of two sons.  Currently struggling financially and in need of community supports.   


Plan:    

Pt's application for rental assistance was approved. 

Appt scheduled for next week.

(NOTE)Reference range: Nonreactive This test for total antibody to Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is used primarily as an indicator of past infection and immunity to HAV. It cannot confirm a recent or acute infection. Patients who receive a HAV vaccine produce serum antibody levels that are typically 10 to 100 fold lower than levels produced from HAV infection. The relatively low levels of serum antibody resulting from intramuscular immune globulin or HAV vaccine may not be detectable by this assay or any other available antibody assays. A negative result following immunization does not imply lack of seroconversion, as protective levels of antibody may be present below the limit of sensitivity of this assay. Post immunization testing for hepatitis A antibodies is not indicated in immunocompetent individuals due to consistently high seroconversion rates.

 Other Data:
 Last week the patient called to report that she felt her heart rate was increased and that she felt lightheaded. Given that she had been taking an increased dose of Lasix, it was possible that she was dehydrated (intravascularly depleted). I asked her to hold Lasix for 2 days and she had her labs rechecked. Her BUN/Cr were stable at 16/1.08. Her NT-proBNP was increased to 2100 (from 900) and she felt increased dyspnea during the 2 days when the Lasix was held. She therefore resumed Lasix 40mg daily and today reports that her dyspnea is improving, and therefore she will continue that dose. Additionally, she has an appointment in November for a repeat TTE given her recent increased requirement for diuretic therapy.

Dear Dr. Wolf, 


I am writing you to update you on your patient, Rudolph Kass. As you know, Judge Kass is an 83-year-old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG/ bioprosthetic AVR (LIMA to LAD and SVG to diagonal) in 2008, with subsequent DES in 2009 and 3/2013, ischemic CMP, LVEF 30%, LBBB (QRS 160ms), sinus node dysfunction, and recurrent episodes of presyncope who was recently admitted with ACS and troponin elevation. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated stable CAD. Telemetry monitoring revealed marked bradycardia limiting the ability to optimize medical therapy with beta blockers, which are needed for CHF/LV dysfunction, CAD, as well as likely for rate control of his tachyarrhythmias. Given the bradycardia indication for pacing, known severely reduced ejection fraction and LBBB with wide QRS, he was taken to the electrophysiology laboratory at the Brigham and Women's Hospital today and underwent successful implantation of left pectoral Medtronic CRT-D. The patient made an uneventful recovery. I will arrange a followup in the appropriate short-term. 


Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this interesting and delightful patient. Please do not hesitate to call me with any further questions. 


Sincerely, 

Melanie Maytin, MD

CTSP for consideration of pacemaker/device therapy 


83M retired judge, very active and highly functional, with CAD s/p CABG/ bioprosthetic AVR (LIMA to LAD and SVG to diagonal) in 2008, with subsequent DES in 2009 and 3/2013, who now presented with ACS and troponin elevation. He underwent catheterization 4/26/14 which revealed stable CAD. 


He has had longstanding sinus bradycardia and LBBB (QRS 155ms). He has tolerated low doses of beta blockers (Toprol decreased from 50mg to 25mg qd). 

Over the last year he has had approximately 5 episodes of LH/presyncope, typically with exertion, and usually associated with a sensation of rapid palpitation, resolved with rest. 

He is active and rides a bike around the city frequently, but has noted a subtle, progressive decline in effort tolerance over ~ 1 year.   


While in house he has had sinus bradycardia on telemetry with rates 40s-50s, occasional high 30s at night. There have also been episodes of brief rapid rhythm, with slight irregularity c/w transient AT/AF- these episodes have the same LBBB QRS morphology as his sinus beats. He has noted transient palpitation while here which apparently corresponded with these episodes on telemetry. 


TTE on 4/26/14 revealed LVEF 30%, with global HK and inferior akinesis. 


PMHx 

-CAD. Cath in 2008 showed 70-80% stenosis of proximal LAD, 95% stenosis of first diagonal and 50-60% narrowing of second diagonal, 30% stenosis of proximal RCA.  

-Underwent CABG in 2009 (concomitant with AV replacement) with LIMA-LAD and SVG-D1 grafts. Subsequently in 2009, during admission for Afluttler and workup for upper shoulder discomfort, was found to have 70% stenosis of second diagonal, patent LIMA-LAD and stump occluded SVG-diagonal. Received BMS to first diagonal and DES to ostium of second diagonal. He subseuntly had a DES stent placed in the LAD in March 2013 

-Aortic insufficiency s/p AVR. In 2008, found to have ,moderate AI with end-diastolic diameter of 6.0 cm, paradoxical septum, EF 35%. In 2009, underwent bovine AVR (#25 Carpentier-Edwards AV).  

-CMP. Prior to his CABG/AVR, ECHO in 2008 showed EF of 30-35% w/ paradoxical septum. Subsequently shown to improve to 45%, now again reported as 30%. 

-Aflutter. Had episode of Aflutter w/ ventricular rates of 80-100 in 2009 which presented as weakness while biking. Received metoprolol with reversion to SR.

At least moderate LV dysfunction with chronic inferolateral HK; EF appears slightly less vigorous but no new WMA c/w 12/2013. Moderate MR, mild TR with estimated PASP 54 mmHg + RA (increased from 27 mmHg + RA 12/2013).

Comments: 

Patent LIMA-LAD. VG-D1 known occluded. Patent ostial LAD stent. 

Patent D1 stent, patent D2 stent. The remaining coronary anatomy is 

stable compared to angio in 2009. There is no culprit for the recent 

NSTEMI.  Mr. Kass had labile hypertension to SBP of 200 that was 

treated with IV nitro during the case. Angio reviewed with Dr. Ho. 



A/P 

83M with ischemic CMP, LVEF now 30%, LBBB, sinus bradycardia, and likely paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias. He has clear sinus node disease, and while this has not been directly correlated with his symptoms, he has had recurrent episodes of presyncope. Furthermore, his bradycardia does limit the ability to optimize beta blockers, which are needed for CHF/LV dysfunction, CAD, as well as likely for rate control of his tachyarrhythmias. He therefore has indication for chronic pacing. 

As his LV function is severely impaired, he is also at risk for ventricular arrhythmias, and qualifies for primary prevention ICD therapy (LVEF <35%, ICMP, NYHA II). Though he is 83yo, he is highly functional and active, and is very much agreeable to having an ICD. 

Furthermore, given his wide LBBB (in addition to NYHA class II symptoms and severe LV dysfunction), he would likely benefit from CRT pacing to avoid long-term adverse cardiac remodeling associated with dyssynchrony. 

-we have therefore recommended and offered implantation of a CRT-D. 

-after device implantation, can uptitrate beta blockade 

-defer to primary team regarding anticoagulation for his paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias.

04/26/2014 


Patient seen with Dr. Bhat- details per her admission note.  Findings and plan confirmed with additions/exceptions below. 


83M s/p CABG/ bioprosthetic AVR (LIMA to LAD and SVG to diagonal branch of LAD) in 2008, with subsequent DES in 2009 to D1, and DES to LAD in 3/2013 (ACS with Tn 0.1 in Costa Rica), who now presents with persistent L. upper back pain and SOB. 


Active at baseline- walks and rides bike.  Subtle, progressive decline in effort tolerance over ~ 1 year.  Also new, asymmetric LE edema since 3/2014 (neg LENIs)- treated qod lasix with partial effect.  Longstanding sinus bradycardia (HR 40s) has been documented without evidence of symptomatic brady. 


Periodic presyncopal spells, including abrupt onset LH, diaphoresis, rapid HR after running up steps while on vacation in Costa Rica 3/2013.  Found to have TnI 0.103 and underwent cath demonstrating stump occl SVG, patent LIMA, and 90% oLAD--> DES.  Recurrent presyncopal symptoms after riding bike uphill 2 d PTA- resolved and felt back to baseline after 5-10 minutes of rest; able to complete all other activities that day and yesterday. 


Yesterday evening, developed dull L. upper back pain and SOB/tachypnea ~MN when trying to go to sleep.  No diaphoresis, LH, N/V.  No chest pain; but no chest pain in prior presentations with CAD/prior to other revasc. Unable to get comfortable overnight- symptoms persisted to am and presented to ED.  Volume overload evident on exam and CXR.  Treated with lasix 20 mg iv x 1 with improvement. 


Currently comfortable- no back pain; no SOB at rest. 

JVP ~12-13 cm, bilateral rales 1/2lung field, II-III/VI mid-peaking SEM, no gallops. Mild bilateral LE edema.  Warm, well-perfused.

Echo 

At least moderate LV dysfunction with chronic inferolateral HK; EF appears slightly less vigorous but no new WMA c/w 12/2013. Moderate MR, mild TR with estimated PASP 54 mmHg + RA (increased from 27 mmHg + RA 12/2013). Aortic valve gradients have decrease to Vm2.6 m/sec, peak/mean gradients 26/12 mmHg (previously Vm 3.4, mean gradient 24). 


A/P 

83M with chronic CAD (2V CABG 2008 with occl SVG, patent LIMA 3/2013), DES D1 and LAD 3/2013 presenting with upper back pain, volume overload and evidence of mild myocardial injury/necrosis by biomarkers. 


Reports mild subacute decline in effort tolerance and volume overload (pedal edema) over the past month.  Repeat echo shows decrease in LVEF with no new WMAs, increase in MR, higher estimated PASP, but no significant aortic prosthetic stenosis (mildly increased gradients on prior study).  Symptoms, worsened overall LV function and (+) biomarkers are concerning for unstable coronary syndrome- currently symptom-free. 

       - Continue to cycle biomarkers; low threshold to start heparin if further increase (and pursue cath) 

       - Diuresis for volume overload 

       - Continue low-dose b-blocker (toprol xl 25 daily outpt dose; follow HR) 

       - BP control 

       - ASA, plavix, statin 


Presyncopal episodes may represent tachy/brady with ?tachy episodes precipitating sxs given his description of rapid HR and episode of PAF captured in clinic 5/2013 

       - Telemetry to monitor for AF and bradyarrhythmias 

       - Consider ambulatory monitoring to better define AF burden, need for anticoagulation and relation to symptoms

Cardiology PGY1 Admission Note 


Name: KASS,RUDOLPH 

MRN: 06354955(BWH) 

DOB: 06/28/30 

Admitting Attending: Carolyn Ho 

Admitting Intern: Shubha L Bhat 

PCP: Marshall Wolf 


CC: L shoulder pain, "winded" 


HPI:  

83 year old gentleman with history of  sinus bradycardia, previous episodes of Aflutter, AI s/p AVR, significant CAD s/p CABG w/ LIMA-LAD and SVG-diagonal grafts, stents x 2 to diagonals, NSTEMI w/ 1 stent to proximal LAD, who now presents with dull, achey left shoulder/scapula pain that started last night while he was sleeping. He describes the pain as 4/10 in severity, lasting ~ 6 hours and went away on its own, without any intervention. He thinks that the pain was musculoskeletal since it was somewhat positional but was worried because he has always had atypical cardiac presentation. He also complains of bring more "winded"over the past several months, especially with exertion such as climbing 2 flights of stairs in the subway. He bikes to work regularly and also recalls that while biking about 3 days ago his heart was beating faster and more irregularly than normal. At the time he also recalls feeling a bit lightheaded, like he was going to faint so he sat down to rest and the sensation went away. He has had this sensation of lightheadedness a few times before, the first of which occured 1 year ago when he was climbing stairs while vacationing in Costa Rica and felt like he was going to pass out. He went to the hospital there, and he reports that he had a troponin elevation and ultimately a stent was placed in his LAD. Finally he complains of increased swelling of both legs (L>R) at the end of a long day after walking around. He had seen Dr. Wolf in clinic about this in early March and underwent LENI which showed no evidence of DVT and he was started on 40mg PO Lasix QOD, which he believes helped the swelling. He ran out of the Lasix ~1 week ago and was scheduled to see Dr. Wolf back in clinic next week to evaluate the effect of the lasix.  


Of note, he had an ECHO in Dec 2013,  that showed an EF of 45%.  


In the ED, vitals:  

Vitals: T 97.5 HR 55 BP 179/96 RR 16 O2 sat 96% on RA 

Exam: crackles, half way up bilaterally. sinus bradycardia (baseline). feels good, walking around 

Imaging: CXR with pulm edema. Bedside echo with depressed EF (compared to echo Dec 2013 with EF 45%) 

Labs: TnT 0.18 

EKG: old left bundle but nonischemic.  

Intervention: 20IV lasix, full dose ASA. 12.5 short acting metop 

Most recent vitals: 45, 145/90, 16 97% RA. Bathroom x3, unknown UOP 

Admitted for evaluation of possible worsening CHF 


ROS:  

As per HPI 


Problems  

-CAD. Long history of exertional neck/shoulder discomfort. Cath in 2008 showed 70-80% stenosis of proximal LAD, 95% stenosis of first diagonal and 50-60% narrowing of second diagonal, 30% stenosis of proximal RCA. Underwent CABG in 2009 (concomitant with AV replacement) with LIMA-LAD and SVG-D1 grafts. Subsequently in 2009, during admission for Afluttler and workup for upper shoulder discomfort, was found to have 70% stenosis of second diagonal, patent LIMA-LAD and stump occluded SVG-diagonal. Received BMS to first diagonal and DES to ostium of second diagonal. He subseuntly had a DES stent placed in the LAD in March 2013 

-Aortic insufficiency s/p AVR. In 2008, found to have ,moderate AI with end-diastolic diameter of 6.0 cm, paradoxical septum, EF 35%. In 2009, underwent bovine AVR (#25 Carpentier-Edwards AV).  

-CHF. Prior to his AVR, ECHO in 2008 showed EF of 30-35% w/ paradoxical septum. In April 2010, myocardial perfusion SPECT stress study (to evaluate for r/o ishcemia dueto neck pain) showed  post-stress LVEF of of 67%, no RWMA, normal LV and RV sizes and wall thickness.  

-Sinus bradycardia. Baseline HR in the 40s-50s

Radiology
Chest PA  AND  Lateral (4/26 8am)
     IMPRESSION: New diffuse interstitial prominence with Kerley
     B-lines, likely due to moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.

EKG: Rate 45, sinus rhythm, LBBB, Q-waves in v1, v2, v3 (unchanged from March 2014) 


MIBI (4/12/2013) 

     Final impression:

     1.  The patient's test results are normal and suggest no evidence
     of flow-limiting CAD.

     2.  Abnormal global LV systolic function.

     3.  The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study of
     Apr 8, 2010.

ECHO (12/30/2013) 

Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is mild to moderately dilated. There is 
normal left ventricular wall thickness. The visually estimated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is mildly reduced at 45%. There is global 
hypokinesis with regional variation. Severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the 
basilar inferior and inferior lateral walls. Hypokinesis of the distal half 
of the lateral wall. Abnormal (paradoxical) motion is consistent with 
post-operative status.

Right Ventricle: Normal right ventricular size, wall thickness, and 
contractility.
Left Atrium: There is severe left atrial enlargement. The calculated LA 
volume via the Area-Length method is 144.63 ml (See 2D Measurements table 
for value indexed for BSA).
Right Atrium: The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Aortic Valve: The peak antegrade aortic valve velocity is 3.3 m/s. The peak 
instantaneous aortic valve gradient is 44.1 mmHg. The mean aortic valve 
gradient is 24.4 mmHg. The aortic prosthesis is a Carpentier pericardial 
bioprosthesis. There is mild aortic valve regurgitation. Well seated 25 mm 
Carpentier-Edwards bovine pericardial valve. Peak velocity of 3.4 m/sec, 
that is higher than prior echo.
Mitral Valve: The mitral valve is mildly diffusely thickened. The peak 
antegrade mitral valve velocity is 0.84 m/s. The peak transmitral gradient 
is 2.79 mmHg. The mean mitral valve gradient is 1.0 mmHg. Moderate mitral 
regurgitation is present.
Tricuspid Valve: The tricuspid valve is structurally normal. Mild tricuspid 
valve regurgitation is present.
Pulmonic Valve: There is no obvious pulmonic valve abnormality. There is 
trace pulmonary valve regurgitation.
Venous: The inferior vena cava is normal in size.
Pericardium/Pleura: No significant pericardial effusion is seen.

Comparison /Summary: A prior study was performed on 9/17/2009. AoV gradients 
have increased.

Assessment 

82 yo male w/ h/o SB, previous episodes of Aflutter, AR s/p AVR, significant CAD s/p CABG w/ LIMA-LAD and SVG-diagonal grafts, stents x 2 to diagonals, recent NSTEMI w/ stent to proximal LAD lesion who presents with history concerning for cardiac event and subsequent volume overload.   


Plan 

# CVp: Volume overloaded on exam. It is possible that he has CHF in the setting of recent cardiac event vs. stenosis of prosthetic valve vs. running out of home lasix. ECHO from Dec 2013 showed EF 45%. h/o AI s/p bovine AVR  

Dx 

- repeat ECHO 

- BMP BID while diuresing 

Tx 

- Lasix 20IV PRN (I/O goal -500cc to -1L per day) 

- Continue home losartan 50mg BID 

- Continue home Metoprolol Succinate 25mg QD 


# CVi: Elevated TnT on admission (0.18) in the setting of possible possible cardiac event, given his anginal equivalent symptoms (recent shoulder pain and lightheadedness). Elevation of cardiac biomarkers could also be in the setting of cardiac stress from CHF.  

Dx 

- CBM B and C set 

- EKG if symptomatic 

- ECHO as above 

- Consider cath vs. stress MIBI, pending CBM results 

- check orthostatics 

Tx 

- Aspirin 81mg QD (s/p 325mg x1 in ED) 

- Plavix 75mg QD (home med from stent placed 1 yr ago) 

- Metoprolol 25mg QD 

- Losartan 50mg BID 

- SL NTG prn pain 

- Consider heparin bolus and gtt if CBM are uptrending 


# CVr: H/o previous episodes of Aflutter as well as longstanding sinus bradycardia with occasional feelings of "heart racing" which could be tachy-brady, SSS. Unclear whether his symptoms of lightheadedness are due to bradycardia or are his anginal equivalent.  

- Pt likely will need event monitor as an outpatient 

- Monitor on tele
- Consider need for pacemaker 

- Check orthostatics 

- Conitnue Metoprolol succinate 25 QD (hold for HR <40) 

- Consider anticoagulation (CHADS2 score is 3/5)  


#GERD.
- Patient no longer taking his home omeprazole. Continue to hold 


#BPH.
-Continue home flomax and finasteride

Rudy comes in because for the last week or so, he has had swelling in his left calf and foot.  This usually is not marked when he first wakes up, but progresses during the day.  By days end it is very uncomfortable for him to have a shoe on his left foot. 


He has not changed his diet in terms of sodium content.  He also is not taking any NSAIDs.  He has not changed his other medications.  He is not having pleurisy or hemoptysis.  He has not noticed any change in his urinary habits.  He thinks perhaps his exercise tolerance is minimally reduced.  He has not had any palpitations.  No fever, chills or sweats.  Review of systems is otherwise negative in detail. 


He is in no acute distress.  Respiratory rate is 14, venous pressure 4, heart rate 72 and regular.  No thyromegaly or nodules.  No rales.  No abdominal masses or tenderness.  No masses or tenderness on rectal exam.  He has 2+ pitting almost to his knee on the left and just a trace of edema in his right ankle. 


I told Rudy we obviously need to get a venous ultrasound to make sure he did not have a DVT.  I was able to arrange for this on an emergent basis.  He came back as soon as he finished the exam, I spoke to the ultrasonographers.  There was no clot either leg (and a Baker's cyst he had on the right has resolved). 


I told him I was not sure why he had asymmetric edema.  We agreed we would try some Lasix to see if we could relieve his edema with the understanding if it persisted or recurred, we might want to do an abdominal study to rule out a process in his pelvis impeding venous return on the left. 


He is going to take Lasix 40 mg every other day and call me after he has taken 2 doses.

19 Dec 2014 CXR:
Persistent findings read as being consistent with interstitial lung disease, not possible to rule out a component of heart failure

TTE May 2013: LVEF 34%
TTE Oct 2013: LVEF 36%
TTE Dec 2014: LVEF 25%

Stress test 27 Jun 2014: no definite ischemia/infarction, I believe the reported LVEF of 49% to be an over-estimate given the consistently depressed LVEF reported on sequential TTEs.

 EKG:
 Normal sinus rhythm with LBBB.

Assessment and Plan: 
80-year-old man with non-ischemic dilated CM with LVEF that has hovered around 35% since 2013 despite comprehensive medical therapy. His LVEF recently dropped to 25% and there is no compelling target for revascularization given the absence of ischemia/infarction on Jun 2014 ETT-MIBI. He also has a LBBB (QRS in 130s) and NYHA Class III symptoms. No diagnoses that would restrict his life expectancy to 1 year or less. He qualifies for CRT-D upgrade. Risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient in detail. He exhibited good understanding and underwent device implant today. He tolerated the procedure well and was admitted for routine post-procedure monitoring.

Cardiomyopathy.. - Severely reduced LVEF despite comprehensive therapy. No changes to his medical regimen today.

Left bundle branch block.. - QRS duration of >130ms and is eligible for CRT-D implant. 

Automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator in situ - CRT-D implant performed today.
- bedrest overnight
- antibiotics as specified in post-procedure orders
- portable CXR one hour after procedure, PA/Lat CXR in AM
- device interrogation in AM
- hold anti-hypertensive medications until tomorrow
 - CRT-D implant performed today.
- bedrest overnight
- antibiotics as specified in post-procedure orders
- portable CXR one hour after procedure, PA/Lat CXR in AM

Hello Mr Tramonte: 


I am happy to hear that you are feeling better, and that the Cefpodoxime worked.  


As for the sneezing, I recommend saline nasal spray 3 to 4 times daily. Most over the counter medications for allergies and sneezing may have cardiac side effects, and we would want to avoid that.

Hi Dr. Ramadan, 


    I hope you had a relaxing New Years Day.  You asked me to check with you before taking any over the counter medication. The cefpodoxime you prescribed for me worked.  I did have diarrhea for a time, but that is long gone.  The question I have is my sneezing.  That continues along with a little phlegm.  Do you want me to take anything for it? 


I am looking forward to having the bi-ventricular ICD implanted a week from this Wednesday.  I do believe it will help my medical condition. 


Thanks,

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

Dear Dr. Semigran,

 Thank you for referring your patient, Mr. Michael Tramonte, for further evaluation of his candidacy for CRT-D implant. As you well know, Mr. Tramonte is an 80-year-old man with a long history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF ~35% since 2013. Despite treatment with comprehensive cardiac therapy, his LVEF was recently noted to be reduced to 25% on Dec 2014 TTE with no evidence of ischemia/infarction noted on ETT-MIBI in June 2014. OHe now reports exertional symptoms consistent with NYHA Class III. No recent palpitations, presyncopal symptoms, or syncopal events. Weight stable, no orthopnea or PND. No recent constitutional complaints, notably no fevers or night sweats.

 Other Data:

TTE Oct 2013: LVEF 36%
TTE Dec 2014: LVEF 25%

Stress test 27 Jun 2014: no definite ischemia/infarction, I believe the reported LVEF of 49% to be an over-estimate given the consistently depressed LVEF reported on sequential TTEs

 EKG:
 Normal sinus rhythm with LBBB (QRS 130 msec).

Assessment and Plan: 
80-year-old man with non-ischemic dilated CM with LVEF that has hovered around 35% since 2013 despite comprehensive medical therapy. His LVEF recently dropped to 25% and there is no compelling target for revascularization given the absence of ischemia/infarction on Jun 2014 ETT-MIBI. He also has a LBBB (QRS in 130s) and NYHA Class III symptoms. No diagnoses that would restrict his life expectancy to 1 year or less. He qualifies for CRT-D upgrade. Risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient in detail. He exhibited good understanding and is willing to proceed with planning for the procedure. 

Cardiomyopathy .. - Severely reduced LVEF despite comprehensive therapy. No changes to his medical regimen today.

Left bundle branch block .. - QRS duration of >130ms and is eligible for CRT-D implant. 

 DX Tests Ordered:
 Chem7, INR, CBC, UA, CXR

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 Followup of dilated cardiomyopathy and shortness of breath and fatigue with exertion.

 Interval History:
 Mr. Tramonte is a 80yo with a long history of LV dysfunction with LVEF 34-50%with features of diastolic dysfunction. He has had negative stress tests in the past and his angiogram in 2007, showed only minimal irregularities without any obstruction. He had a CPET at St Elizabeth's hospital in 2011 which showed peak VO2 of 24.5ml/kg/min which was 109% predicted. Unfortunately, he hs ongoing fatigue with exertion, sometimes associated with low blood pressure and lightheadedness. At his last clinic visit we reduced lisinopril, and he has noted less frequent low blood pressure readings. He is trying to pace his activity and has had less exertional drops in BP as well. He feels he has more energy over the past few months and has been doing more exercise and activity. This has resulted in more frequent shortness of breath. 

He is working out at the gym 4-5 times a week using the bike and walking on the treadmill for 7-14 mins. He also does about 5 minutes of arm exercises. When he does activities requiring his arms, he has more prolonged fatigue and more easy dyspnea. Overall, he is most limited by fatigue. He denies palpitations or chest discomfort. He has been tracking his weight and blood pressures daily. His BP runs in the 104-127/61-78 range with HR 60-70's. He had 7 readings in the 88-97 range systolic. His weight is stable at 145-147. His symptoms are consistent with NYHA Class III. 

He does not drink much fluid throughout the day.

Assessment and Plan: 
Mr Tramonte is a 80yo with a long history of LV dysfunction according to echocardiograms between 2005 and 2011 with LVEF's ranging from a low of 41 up to 61%. His most recent echo showed a reduction in LV function to EF 36%, stable from prior. He describes significant fatigue/exhaustion with any activity. He has no ischemia on recent stress test images.

Cardiomyopathy .. - Mr. Tramonte appears to be euvolemic or somewhat dry. We encouraged him to drink at least 48 ounces (and no more than 2 liters). We will continue his current regimen of neurohormonal blockade which ahs allowed him to be more active with less hypotension. 

He will continue to monitor his daily weights and let us know if he develops any symptoms of fluid retention. He will continue walking in intervals with rest periods in between to avoid undue fatigue. He is working with personal trainor. 

Left bundle branch block .. - We will get a repeat echocardiogram, now that he is on maximum medical therapy. If his LVEF is 35% or less, we will refer him to EPS for consideration of device therapy. He has QRS duration of >130ms and may be eligible for CRT therapy. 

Habits/Risk Screening: 
Smoking status: never smoked Quit in 1955. Smoked very little
Alcohol use status: none/minimal Does not drink alcohol
Drug use status: none 
Activity level: moderate back to the gym 4-5 times a week

Disposition:
return to clinic in 4 months

Living/family situation and support system: "Chipp" is a 25 year old single, Caucasian male who lives in New Hampshire. Pt lives with two roommates and his parents live nearby. Pt reports that he lives approximately 45 minutes from Boston and his parents are approximately 1.5 hours away, therefore they have been staying in the hospital overnight. Pt cites his mother and step-father as sources of great support to him, both practically and emotionally. He also cites an extensive network of friends whom he finds supportive. He reports that he has friends who will be able to drive him to and from work while he is unable to do so.   


Work/educational status: Pt works for new car dealerships. He reports that his job involves a lot of driving.


Financial/Insurance issues: None reported. BC out of state PPO for insurance.


Brief history of current health status/comorbidities:  Per LMR, 25-year-old male transferred from OSH for further evaluation and management in the setting of an out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrest 11/05 and newly documented dilated cardiomyopathy, LVEF 10-15%. Please refer to medical record for complete medical hx.


Patient's/Family's understanding of illness/diagnosis: Chipp and his family are self-reported "squeaky wheels" and wish to understand all details related to his illness. Pt reports a good understanding of his illness today, stating that he believes communication between himself and the medical team has much improved since his first day of admission which he appreciates.


Patient's/Family's goals of care: Pt would like to return to work as soon as possible. He is frustrated by his driving limitation as driving is a key component of his job, however, he has been able to work with his manager to ensure that he is able to return to work without problem for a week or so until he can resume driving again.


Mental health history: Pt does not endorse a hx of anxiety or depression. No SI/HI. Pt does endorse feelings of increased frustration given the length of this hospitalization coupled with his desire to remain active. Pt and SW reviewed ways for pt to cope, including taking walks around the floor to ease his restlessness.


Alcohol/tobacco/substance history: Pt is a social drinker. Lifelong non smoker. No illicit substance use reported. 


Abuse/DV history: screening completed. None reported at this time. 


Advanced Directives/HC Proxy: Pt reports that his mother is HCP. Copy not located in chart. Will f/u with pt re: documentation


Other risks and concerns: Pt's birthday is Sunday, 11/17/2013, and he was hoping to be d/c home by then. Pt may need additional support on Sunday as he prepares for ICD placement scheduled for Monday. Pt reports that any distractions from procedure are helpful to him. 


Additional Info:  Assessment 

Narrative: "Chipp" is a 25 year old man who lives in NH with two roommates. Pt presents today as A+ox3, sitting up in bed and engaging with SW. Pt reports feeling increasingly frustrated with the length of his hospitalization as he states that he is very active at baseline and enjoys being busy. Pt is able to display insight into effective coping mechanisms such as taking walks around the floor to help ease his feelings of restlessness. He spent time discussing his frustrations that he will need to spend his 26th birthday (Sunday 11/17) in the hospital but uses humor to cope.  Pt has found visits by his friends, co-workers and family helpful and encouraging.

Attending: Dr. Michael Sweeney 

REASON FOR CONSULT: cardiac arrest 


HPI: Mr. Chipp is a pleasant 25 year-old gentleman who was previously healthy, without cardiac history presented after VF arrest. Patient had a witnessed arrest where coworkers found him slumped over his desk and unresponsive. Bystander CPR was performed and he was found in VF upon EMS arrival. He was defibrillated to sinus rhythm.  Workup at OSH subsequently revealed newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy, EF 10-15%.  ECG also showed LBBB. Troponin 0.58, nl TSH, utox + benzodiazepine, Lyme/ANA negative.  LHC showed normal coronary anatomy without obstructive disease, elevated LVEDP 25-30mmHg.  MRI/MRA did not show acute findings.  He underwent cooling per hypothermia protocol with almost full neurologic recovery.  Patient was transferred here for further evaluation.  


Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, prior syncope, recent illness, fever or sick contacts. However, 1 month ago, he had a brief episode of chest discomfort which lasted 20 minutes with associated shortness of breath for a few minutes.

Echo 11/11/13: Moderately dilated LV (LVEDD 6.9 cm), with normal wall thickness, severely depressed LVEF 15-20%.  The lateral wall is best preserved.  Normal RV size/function.  Normal biatrial sizes. No significant valvular abnormalities.

cMRI 11/14/13: 

1. Severely dilated left ventricular size (LVIDd=77 mm) with severely impaired systolic function (LVEF=20%). There is paradoxical septal motion.   The LV is dyssynchronous by qualitative assessment. Normal RV size/function. 

2. Normal resting perfusion study. There was no late gadolinium enhancement to indicate myocardial infarction, scar, or infiltration.   There was evidence of mild diffuse myocardial edema by T2 weighted imaging mostly affecting the basal inferior and basal inferolateral segments. There was no evidence of increased iron deposition within the myocardium (T2*myocardium=26; if < 20 msec, suggestive of iron-overloading of the myocardium). Overall, appearances are consistent with a non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.  No evidence of infiltrative or inflammatory causes such as sarcoidosis or amyloidosis. 

Cath 11/15/13: Normal right and left heart filling pressures, LVEF 20% 

ASSESMENT: Mr. Chipp is a 25 year-old gentleman with OOH witnessed cardiac arrest, found in VF, successfully resucitated after bystander CPR and defibrillation, with newly diagnosed nonischemic dilated cardmiomyopathy EF 15-20%, LBBB, and normal coronary anatomy.  There was no late gadolinium enhancement on cMRI to indicate myocardial infarction, scar, or infiltration.    

Plan: 

-prior to hospital discharge, will plan for ICD for secondary prevention. Patient has NICMP and LBBB 150 ms and may potentially benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy; though newly diagnosed NICMP without trial of medical therapy, will discuss possibility of CRT-D at time of ICD implant. 

-consider discontinuation of amiodarone

CCU TRANSFER OUT NOTE  

NAME: Chipp, Stephen 

MRN: 28738789 

DATE: 11/1413 

CHIEF COMPLAINT: vfib arrest and new dilated cardiomyopathy 


HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:Mr. Chipp is a 25 y/o M who is being transferred to the BWH CCU from Elliott Hospital in Manchester, NH, for further workup of a new onset cardiomyopathy.  On 11/5/2013, he was working at his desk at a Toyota dealership and coworkers saw him slump over and was unresponsive.  His coworkers began bystander CPR.  When EMS arrived, he was found to be in vfib and one shock was delivered with an additional 2 minutes of CPR.  Estimated down time before ROSC was approximately 14-16 minutes.  Patient was intubated in the Elliott Hospital ED with pulse and repirations, but was not moving extremities and not following commands.  Per coworkers, pt had been complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath on two occasions during the month prior to presentation.  TTE was done and found to have a globally dilated LV with EF 10-15%.  EKG showed LBBB.  Electrolytes were normal upon presentation, urine was positive for benzos, troponin I was 0.58, CKMB 12, NT pro BNP 1822,    


Patient was transferred to the ICU and was cooled per hypothermia protocol.  Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary anatomy.  Workup had been inconclusive in terms of determining etiology of vfib arrest.  Lyme disease titers and ANA were negative.  Ferritin level was 407, but not suggestive of hemochromatosis.  Viral cultures and HIV pending, selenium, carnitine, and thiamine were pending at time of transfer.  There was some initial concern for basilar artery thrombosis based on head CT images, however MRI/MRA was negative.  There was also questionable seizure activity because patient had urinary incontinence and lacerated lip.  After hypothermia protocol was complete, patient was awake but not tolerating endotracheal tube.  Patient vomited and aspirated at one point leading to aspiration pneumonia (E coli sensitive to cefazolin).  Patient remained intubated, sedated with propofol and precedex.  Patient also was on low dose norepinephrine 


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unable to obtain as patient intubated and sedated. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 

pertussis age 5 


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 

none 


SOCIAL HISTORY: 

lives with 2 roommates.  Works at IRA Toyota.  No tobacco or drug history.  Occasional social ethanol.  Works out at gym regularly.  Parents stated that he was using high doses of energy drinks (caffeine and taurine), but had recently discontinued them as they ere casuing chest pain. 


FAMILY HISTORY:  Biological father not seen since age 8, health unknown.  Maternal grandfather CABG age 50; paternal grandfather also with early CAD.   


PRE-ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 

patient took no medications prior to initial hospitalizations 


Upon transfer, medications included 

- heparin gtt 

- propofol gtt 

- fentanyl gtt 

- precedex gtt 


ALLERGIES: 

none reported 


CCU COURSE: 


#CVp: Patient with new onset heart failure, LVEF 15-20%.  Etiology unknown, clean coronaries at OSH.  The viral serologies and iron studies at the OSH were negative, and not suggestive of hemochromatosis.  Excessive energy drink consumption is a possibility.  Autoimmune, inflitrative, etc. are ont he differential.  As of 11/12 HIV was negative, parvovirus IgG was positive, lyme negative, adenovirus negative, RSV negative, all other tests pending.  As of 11/12, etiology still unclear.  Repeat echo showed low EF as above with diffusely patchy hypokinesis. Given dilation on echo, the presentation was thought more concerning for more subacute to chronic process.. He was viewed as essentially euvolemic and so he was not actively diuresed. With regards to heart failure regimen, he was started and aggressively uptitratred on captopril.  


The CHF team was consulted as to new cardiomyopthy and agreed with plan for MRI, potentially to be followed with a RHC with potential biopsy.  


#CVr: Presentation c/w vfib arrest.  Likely secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy.  Could potentially be 2/2 vasospasm, or electrolyte abnormalities although less likely.  Patiet has been in normal sinus with LBBB since arrival. HR trended up initially from 90s to 110-120s. One ECG on 11/13 suggestive of possible atrial flutter vs atrial tachycardia. We considered initiation of anticoagulation +/- antiarrhythmic, but decided to hold off further given uncertainty about rhythm. EP was consulted and agreed that pt should get secondary prevention ICD prior to discharge.  


#Respiratory status: patient intubated on admission after Vfib arrest and agitation.  Was not extubated given agitation 11/9 upon SBT and aspiration.  Patient had SBT on 11/12 and was subsequently extubated.  NTG gtt was started pre extubation to prevent pulmonary edema, then was weaned s/p extubation.

#Pneumonia: aspiration pneumonia after vomiting during SBT at OSH.  At OSH, grew E Coli, Staph, and strep pneumo.  Was briefly on vanc/unasyn and was switched to cefazolin for a couple days before transfer.  Patient was febrile up to 102 when he arrived at BWH, and SVR decreased, SVO2 increased.  Was started on vanc/zosyn, then switched to vanc/cefepime/flagy.  OSH sensitivities showed all sensitive to ceftriaxone. 


PHYSICAL EXAM:   

(please see daily progress note) 


LAB STUDIES: 

(please see daily progress note) 


ASSESSMENT: 25M with new onset cardiomyopathy (EF 10-15%) found after out of hospital vfib arrest.  

PLAN: 


#CVp: patient with new onset heart failure, LVEF 15-20%.  Etiology unknown, clean coronaries at OSH.  The viral serologies and iron studies at the OSH were negative, and not suggestive of hemochromatosis.  Excessive energy drink consumption is a possibility.  Autoimmune, inflitrative, etc. are on the differential.  Per CHF, likely subacute to chronic process based on dilatation.  Mental status improving but agitated at times.
Dx:
-- F/u ESR, CRP
-- Cardiac MRI today at 1:30PM 

-- Consider right heart cath with ?biopsy pending cardiac MRI findings
-- F/u viral labs - coxsackie, adenovirus, echovirus, CMV, TB, lyme (-), HIV (-)  


Tx:
-- Continue to uptitrate captopril for afterload reduction; goal SBP < 120 ideal, MAPs in the 80s
-- Consider beta blocker for long term management after acute decompensation resolves
-- I/O goal: even to negative 500 with lasix prn (avoid running positive but has been autodiuresing)
-- To CHF team 


#CVr: s/p vfib arrest.  Likely secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy.  Could potentially be 2/2 vasospasm, or electrolyte abnormalities although less likely.  Pt newly tachycardic, most likely normal physiological response in the setting of agitation but with some c/f a flutter vs AFib overnight.  Repeat EKG this morning showed sinus tachycardia.   

-- If subsequent EKGs c/f AFlutter or AFib would trial adenosine  

-- If pt in AFib or Aflutter consider anticoagulation and role for amiodarone 

-- TBW EP regarding placement of an ICD or CRT for secondary prevention.  Have seen him and would like to see cardiac MRI 

#Pneumonia: aspiration pneumonia after vomiting during SBT at OSH.  At OSH, grew E Coli, Staph, and strep pneumo.  Was briefly on vanc/unasyn and was switched to cefazolin for a couple days before transfer.  Patient was febrile up to 102 when he arrived at BWH.  Successfully extubated 11/12 and on RA. 11/11 Sputum Cx +4 E Coli sensitive to cefepime, levaquin
-- F/u micro data
-- Narrow coverage to cefepime, planned 8-day course (ending 11/19) 

-- Would consider narrowing to levofloxain 11/15

11/11/2013 

Mr. Chip is a 25-year-old male who was transferred from Elliot Hospital for further evaluation and management after a cardiac arrest.  He is a 25-year-old male who was previously healthy.  He was witnessed to slump over on his desk at work.  He had bystander CPR and EMS was activated.  He was found to be in ventricular fibrillation and was cardioverted.  He was admitted to Elliot Hospital.  Echocardiogram showed ejection fraction of 15%.  Cardiac catheterization showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  He was initially on vasopressor support, which was weaned off and transferred to Brigham for further management.  His premorbid condition,  he was generally quite healthy without apparent preexisting condition.  Per family and co-workers he may have had some chest discomfort and shortness of breath within the weeks prior to presentation, although this is inconsistent in its report.  At Elliot Hospital, he had no further arrhythmia.  He was treated with a hypothermia protocol.  He had viral serologies which were pending at the time of his discharge.  When extubation was attempted, he had evidence of aspiration and possible pneumonia. 


MEDICATIONS:  His medications on transfer were heparin and cefazolin as well as propofol. 


SOCIAL HISTORY:  He works in car dealing.  He does not use alcohol or drugs. 


FAMILY HISTORY:  He has not seen his biological father, is not aware of his health.  His maternal grandfather had CABG.  His mother is well.   


On presentation, he is afebrile.  He was intubated and sedated.  His eyes opened to stimuli.  His jugular venous pressure was elevated.  His heart showed regular rate and rhythm with a third heart sound.  He was clear to auscultation, soft, nontender, well perfused.  Labs are per the house officer's note.  ECG showed sinus rhythm with left bundle-branch block.  Chest x-ray showed some mild pulmonary edema.  The transthoracic echo showed evidence of left ventricular dilation, some regional differences, but overall poor global function with EF of 15%. 


ASSESSMENT:  This is a 25-year-old male with newly diagnosed nonischemic cardiomyopathy status post cardiac arrest with status post hypothermia protocol now transferred for further management.  His ventilatory parameters seem favorable for the possibility of extubation.  From a diagnostic standpoint, we will review the outside serologies.  We will perform a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study to look for any evidence of patterns of inflammation or infiltration.  The Advanced Heart Failure service and electrophysiology service, likely he will require an ICD for secondary prevention and possibly a CRT device given his broad QRS complex.

CC: OSH transfer after cardiac arrest, trasfered to BWH for w/u of newly dxd dilated CDM  

HPI: 25 yo otherwise healthy man who had a witnessed VF arrest in the setting of a 1 month of sx of CP/SOB, found to have a dilated CDM-EF 15%, clean coronaries ccb PNA, transferred to BWH for further w/u. 

Per parents report the pt was extremely functional and active until one month PTA when he was noted to complain to a co-worker regarding chest pain and dyspnea. More extensive history regarding his sx is not available but he again complained of similar sx 2 days prior to his arrest.  

On 11/4 he had a witnessed VF arrest at workHe was pulseless for at least 15 min prior to ROSC following defibrillation and CPR.  

At OSH he was HD stable without further arrhythmia but was initiated on cooling protocol. W/u was notable for clean coronaries but newly dxd dilated CDM with EF 15%. W/u for viral etiologies and HHC were unrevealing. CCB VAP that limited attempts at extubation. Pt was intermittently on low dose levophed for BP support but was later weaned off. He was continued on broad spectrum abx and was started on a heparin gtt given his dilated LV. He was transferred to BWH for further management.\ 

His parents deny any family history of CHF. They report heavy use of energy drinks but deny toxic habits.

A/p: 25 yo otherwise healthy man who had a witnessed VF arrest in the setting of a 1 month of sx of CP/SOB, found to have a dilated CDM-EF 15%, clean coronaries ccb PNA, transferred to BWH for further w/u. Still collecting OSH w/u and labs but at present the etiology of his VF arrest appears to be 2/2 his dilated cardiomyopathy from an as yet idiopathic cause. The dilatation of his LV and his report of sx suggest a subacute chronicity to his CDM. From his OSH records there is no CAD or positive viral serologies and iron studies are not c/w HHC. His family denies any drug or EtOH use but they report extensive energy drink use, so toxic ingestion is possible. Will evaluate further for any infectious, autoimmune or infiltrative etiologies with lab w/u and plan for CMR. Currently febrile with dropping CVP, so holding diuresis and institution of CHF regimen pending stablization of hemodynamics. Will panculture and broaden abx but still attempt to extubate.

CCU ADMISSION NOTE  


NAME: Chipp, Stephen 

MRN: 28738789 

DATE: 11/11/2013 

PCP: GOLOSARSKY, BORIS; ST.JOSEPH INTERNAL MEDICINE-SKY MEADOW;  387 EAST DUNSTABLE ROAD,SUITE 3 NASHUA, NH 03062;  603-891-2161  


CHIEF COMPLAINT: cardiac arrest 


HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  Mr. Chipp is a 25 y/o M who is being transferred to the BWH CCU from Elliott Hospital in Manchester, NH, for further workup of a new onset cardiomyopathy.  On 11/5/2013, he was working at his desk at a Toyota dealership and coworkers saw him slump over and was unresponsive.  His coworkers began bystander CPR.  When EMS arrived, he was found to be in vfib and one shock was delivered with an additional 2 minutes of CPR.  Estimated down time before ROSC was approximately 14-16 minutes.  Patient was intubated in the Elliott Hospital ED with pulse and repirations, but was not moving extremities and not following commands.  Per coworkers, pt had been complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath on two occasions during the month prior to presentation.  TTE was done and found to have  aglobally dilated LV with EF 10-15%.  EKG showed LBBB.  Electrolytes were normal upon presentation, urine was positive for benzos, troponin I was 0.58, CKMB 12, NT pro BNP 1822,   


Patient was transferred to the ICU and was cooled per hypothermia protocol.  Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary anatomy.  Workup had been inconclusive in terms of determining etiology of vfib arrest.  Lyme disease titers and ANA were negative.  Ferritil level was 407, but not suggestive of hemochromatosis.  Viral cultures and HIV pending, selenium, carnitine, and thiamine were pending at time of transfer.  There was some initial concern for basilar artery thrombosis based on head CT images, however MRI/MRA was negative.  There was also questionable seizure activity because patient had urinary incontinence and lacerated lip.  After hypothermia protocol was complete, patient was awake but not tolerating endotracheal tube.  Patient vomited and aspirated at one point leading to aspiration pneumonia (E coli sensitive to cefazolin).  Patient remained intubated, sedated with propofol and precedex.  Patient also was on low dose norepinephrine

Study Name Portable Chest
Accession # A13256885
Status Final  

From OSH 

sputum: moderate staph, light E coli, moderate strep pneumo. 

MRI/MRA neck normal 


EKG: normal sinus rhythm at 90 with Left bundle branch block (my read). 


ASSESSMENT:  Mr. Chipp is a 25 y/o M with new onset cardiomyopathy (EF 10-15%) found after out of hospital vfib arrest.   


PLAN: 

# CVp - patient with new onset heart failure, LVEF 15-20%.  Etiology unknown, clean coronaries at OSH.  The viral serologies and iron studies at the OSH were negative, and not suggestive of hemochromatosis.  Excessive energy drink consumption is a possibility.  Autoimmune, inflitrative, etc. are ont he differential. 

-- cardiac MRI 

-- consult heart failure 11/11 for utility of cath with biopsy 

-- follow up viral labs - coxsackie, adenovirus, echovirus, CMV, TB, lyme (-), HIV (pending at OSH),  

-- f/u repeat echo (done 11/11) 

-- given 1 month subacute presentation of SOB/CP, enough time to form a clot, continue heparin for now 

-- start on low dose captopril 

-- consider beta blocker for long term management after acute decompensation resolves 


# CVr - vfib arrest.  Likely secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy.  Could potentially be 2/2 vasospasm, or electrolyte abnormalities although less likely 

-- consider consult EP for possible placement of an ICD or CRT 


# Respiratory status - patient intubated upon admission after Vfib arrest and agitation.  Was not extubated given agitation 11/9 upon SBT and aspiration. 

-- SBT in am 11/12 

-- potentially extubate and wean sedation if tolerates SBT 


# Pneumonia - aspiration pneumonia after vomiting during SBT at OSH.  At OSH, grew E Coli, Staph, and strep pneumo.  Was briefly on vanc/unasyn and was switched to cefazolin for a couple days before transfer.  Patient was febrile up to 102 when he arrived at BWH. 

-- vanc and zosyn restarted 11/11 given high temperature and the fact that cultures were done elsewhere.

Manning Curtis, M.D. 

HeartSafe 

565 Turnpike Street 

North Andover, MA 01845 


Dear Manning, 


Thank you for asking me to see this pleasant 87-year-old gentleman who was noted to have left bundle-branch block during a preoperative evaluation prior to minor surgery.  He was accompanied by his daughter and his daughter-in-law when he came to see me at HeartSafe today. 


The patient is quite active playing golf during the golf season and has no major cardiac symptoms.  The discovery of a left bundle-branch block lead to event monitoring as well as an echocardiography.  The echocardiography showed global LV hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 35% and event monitoring revealed periods of 2:1 AV block and Wenckebach type of AV block during the sleeping hours.  He denies any history suggestive of bradyarrhythmias.  In particular, there has been no syncope or presyncopal sensation.  There was never any evidence for high-grade AV block or complete AV block. 


His echocardiogram also showed evidence for mild aortic stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation.  Pulmonary artery pressures estimated by echocardiography was 60 mmHg. 


There is no major past medical history of note.  In particular, there is no history of diabetes or hypertension.  Today's clinical examination revealed him to be well appearing with no carotid or subclavian bruits.  Pulses are equal bilaterally.  He was in sinus rhythm with a blood pressure of 110/70.  There was a soft systolic murmur on auscultation, but lung fields are clear.  Abdominal examination was negative.  I did not have a 12-lead ECG to review today. 


In conclusion, this gentleman who was incidentally discovered to have evidence for a cardiomyopathy and left bundle-branch block has minimal associated symptoms.  Given the finding of intermittent heart block and LV dysfunction, I think it is entirely reasonable to proceed to cardiac catheterization to define his coronary anatomy and exclude reversible causes of his cardiomyopathy.  If this turns out to be unremarkable, I think it would be reasonable to proceed to intracardiac electrophysiological testing to ensure that he does not have infra-Hisian AV block.  In the absence of significant His-Purkinje disease, one could take the view that we will continue to monitor him and observe for worsening symptoms or LV function.  However, if he does have evidence for significant conduction system disease, one would be obliged to implant at least a pacemaker to prevent syncopal spells.  If one were to proceed along these lines, it may be worth considering cardiac resynchronization therapy because this alone may improve his ejection fraction and prevent deterioration to the point of developing heart failure in the future.  Given his age, I did not feel particularly inclined towards defibrillator therapy because the value of such therapy in asymptomatic patients, especially in this age group has never been shown to be substantial. 


Once this cardiac catheterization has been performed, I look forward to hearing from you so that we can proceed to EP studies. 


I have had a long discussion with the patient and his family explaining the rationale for the above thought poses and they will get in touch with me once cardiac catheterization results are available. 


Once again, many thanks for referring him. 


With kindest regards. 


Yours sincerely,

CARDIOLOGY FELLOW CONSULT NOTE  


CC: Mechanical valve IE  


HPI: 64 yo M w/ a PMH of IE in 1989 w/ mechanical AVR/MVR c/w multiple tsf resulting in Hep C, CHF w/ EF 35%, Burkitt Lymphoma in 2011 s/p chemo now in remission who presented on 7/26 w/ fevers and bacteremia. 3/4 bottles are positive for GPC in chains. He is on coumadin for his mechanical valves. His outpatient cardiologist is Dr. Patrick O'Gara. 


Patient has a h/o bacteremia - 2 episodes in the past. Once had group B strep which was treated w/ 2 weeks of IV CTX in 9/12 and S. Mitis which was treated w/ 6 weeks of IV CTX given concern for possible joint seeding (all cultures negative) in his knee. He has never had a documented case of IE of the mechanical valves.  


He is also presenting w/ a rash on his glans penis and known genital HSV. No other localizing sx of infection.  


Also of note,  he was recently put on PCN ppx following two episodes of cellulitis leading to bacteremia and an ICU admission.  About 3 weeks ago, he stopped taking the PCN and decided to take an herbal supplement called Silver Shield instead. He is very frustrated w/ his repeated epidoses of bacteremia.  


ED: fever to 102, HR and BP stable. BCX and UCX sent. Head CT and CXR were negative. Started empirically on vanc, ctx and acyclovir.

CARDIOLOGY  

TEE 11/13/12 

Left Ventricular: The left ventricle is normal in size. There are pacer leads seen in the right  

atrium and right ventricle without any objective evidence of vegetations. 

Left Atrium: No organized thrombus is visualized in the left atrium or  appendage. 

Aortic Valve: Bi-leaflet mechanical valve is well seated in the aortic  

position. No valvular vegetation identified. No perivalvular abscess. There  

is no aortic regurgitation or paravalvular leak. 

Mitral Valve: A mechanical valve is well-seated in the mitral valve  

position, and appears to be functioning normally. Interrogation of the  

prosthetic mitral valve reveals no perivalvular leak. There are two small  

jets of closure MR that are likely the normal closure jets for the bileaflet  

prosthesis. No valvular vegetation identified. The peak antegrade mitral  

valve velocity is 1.79 m/s. The peak transmitral gradient is 12.82 mmHg. The  

mean mitral valve gradient is 5.0 mmHg. 

Tricuspid Valve: No valvular vegetation identified. 

Pulmonic Valve: The pulmonic valve is not well seen due to shadowing  

artifact from the mechanical aortic valve. 

Aorta: Mild to moderate atherosclerotic changes of the ascending aorta and  

descending aorta is noted. 


TTE 11/3/13 

IVS, d 1.4 cm RWT 0.4  

LV, d 5.8 cm LV Mass (AL) 324 g 

LV, s 5.2 cm LV Mass (BSA) 400 g/m? 

LVPW 1.1 cm Aortic Root, d 4.0 cm 

LA, s 4.5 cm 

Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is mildly dilated. There is mild upper  

septal left ventricular hypertrophy. The visually estimated left ventricular  

ejection fraction is moderately-to-severely reduced at 35%. There is global  

hypokinesis with regional variation. Abnormal (paradoxical) motion is  

consistent with RV pacemaker function. Micro bubbles are seen in the left  

ventricle, a possible marker of hemolysis. 

Right Ventricle: Normal right ventricular size, wall thickness, and  

contractility. A pacemaker or AICD wires are seen in the right heart. 

Left Atrium: There is mild left atrial enlargement. 

Right Atrium: The right atrium is mildly dilated. 

Aortic Valve: A mechanical valve is well-seated in the aortic position.  

Interrogation of the prosthetic aortic valve reveals no perivalvular leak.  

The peak antegrade aortic valve velocity is 3.7 m/s. The peak instantaneous  

aortic valve gradient is 54.9 mmHg. The mean aortic valve gradient is 38.7  

mmHg. This is elevated for this type of valve in this position. No valvular  

vegetation identified. 

Mitral Valve: No valvular vegetation identified. A mechanical valve is  

well-seated in the mitral valve position, and appears to be functioning  

normally. Interrogation of the prosthetic mitral valve reveals no  

perivalvular leak. The peak antegrade mitral valve velocity is 2.33 m/s. The  

peak transmitral gradient is 21.75 mmHg. The mean mitral valve gradient is  

4.4 mmHg. Trace mitral regurgitation is present. 

Tricuspid Valve: The tricuspid valve is structurally normal. The tricuspid  

regurgitant velocity is 3.08 m/s, and with an assumed right atrial pressure  

of 20.0 mmHg, the estimated right ventricular systolic is severly elevated  

at 58.0 mmHg. No valvular vegetation identified. Mild tricuspid valve  

regurgitation is present. 

Pulmonic Valve: There is no obvious pulmonic valve abnormality. There is  

trace pulmonary valve regurgitation. No valvular vegetation identified. 

Aorta: The aortic root size is mildly dilated, measuring 4.00 cm at the  

sinuses. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated measuring 4.5cm. 

Pulmonary Artery: The pulmonary artery appears normal in size. 

Venous: The inferior vena cava measures 3.1 cm. 

Pericardium/Pleura: No significant pericardial effusion is seen. 

Comparison /Summary: A prior TTE study was performed on 8/31/12. Compared  

with the prior study there remains a mechanical valve present in both the  

aortic and mitral positions. The mean aortic gradient is elevated and 38 mm  

Hg and the mean mitral gradient is normal at 4.4 mm Hg. No obvious valvular  

vegetations are identified on the aortic or mitral prostheses or on the  

native tricuspid or pulmonic valves or pacer wires. If clinical suspicion of  

endocarditis is high, recommend TEE, a more sensitive test. Moderate to  

severe global LV systolic dysfunction. The estimated LVEF is 35%. RV size  

and systolic function are normal. 


EKG 7/27/13: Vpaced at 80, no change compared to prior  


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  

64 yo M w/ a PMH of IE in 1989 w/ mechanical AVR/MVR, CHF w/ EF 35% (c/w multiple tsf resulting in Hep C, CHF w/ EF 35%, Burkitt Lymphoma in 2011 s/p chemo now in remission who presented on 7/26 w/ fevers and bacteremia. 3/4 bottles are positive for GPC in chains. He is on coumadin for his mechanical valves. Cardiology is consulted for management of his IE. As regards this, would be prudent to bypass TTE and go straight to TEE given his long/repeated history w/ IE and mechanical valves. No new murmurs and he has never had IE of his mechanical valves before so this is reassuirng. The nidus of this recurrent bacteremia is unclear. I seriously doubt that there is anything on any of the mechcnical valves that is reseeding but can be assessed with TEE. Would continue his anticoagulation. Would consult ID. Normally we check daily EKG's for these people to look for perivavular abscess or anterior MV issues - anything that could interfere with the conduction system. PR is not able to be assessed w/ v paced rhythm. However, if he goes back into native rhythm, check daily EKG's. Daily BCX until clear. Once this issue is resolved, would refer him to EP for consideration of CRT-D (given chronic RV pacing, EF 35% and wide QRS on the most recent EKG that I can find where he is not Vpaced the entire time from 4/12. Would check Dig level as well. Can continue aldactone (watch K) and torsemide unless he becomes septic - volume status appears euvolemic now.  

- TEE (would skip TTE)  

- Daily EKG if goes back into native rhythm 

- Daily BCX 

- Consult ID 

- Check Dig level 

- Continue aldactone and torsemide but can certinaly hold if he b/c septic 

- Once resolved, consider referral back to EP for consideration of CRT-D/ICD upgrade (has class 1 indications for both) and high degree of RV pacing back on EKG review  


Patient seen and d/w the consult attending Dr. Creager. The regular consult fellow will continue to follow.  

Please page cardiology consult pager with any additional questions.  

Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.

Chart reviewed. Patient interviewed snd examined. See note above for details. I agree with findings and recommendations. I note that he is not on a beta blocker or ACE inhibitor and he indicated to mehis reluctance to take these medication. I would not start at this time, but suggest that he discuss addition of these meds with his primary cardiologist.

CC/HPI:    

Mr. Murphy is a 64 yo M with a history of endocarditis in 1989, leading to MVR and AVR, HCV 2/2 blood transfusion in 1989 during valve repair, CHF (EF 35%), Burkitt's lymphoma s/p chemo 2011 (now in remission), and two episodes of bacteremia [group B strep bacteremia (s/p 2 weeks IV Ceftriaxone in Sept 2012) and S. mitis bacteremia (s/p 6 weeks of IV Ceftriaxone given concern of possible SC septic joint though Cx remained negative)], and genital HSV, and 2 episodes of cellulitis (july 2012 and most recently 2/2013) who presented with high fevers and found to have 4/4 GPC in chains growing from his blood. We are asked to help with management. He initially had cellulitis back in July 2012 treated at an OSH and then in september presented with group B strep bacteremia and was treated with 2 weeks of IV ceftriaxone. He then in November had S. Mitis bacteremia/septic shock and TTE was negative. He also had a right psoas collection which was aspirated and was negative, but he was treated with 6 weeks of IV ceftriaxone and then was continued in december until June on suppressive PO PCN V, which he stopped because he wanted to try Silver shield, which is a homeopathic remedy. Also in february he had an admission for RLE cellulitis treated initially with Vanc/clinda and then d/c'd on 14 day course of clindamycin. Blood cultures at that time were negative. Three weeks ago he stopped his PCN and he has been feeling fine until this past monday when he developed a low grade temperature. During this week he had low grade temps and then on Friday he woke up with a temp of 102.8 and felt nauseated and had a slight HA on top of his head relieved by ibuprofen. He denied neck stiffness, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, sob, joint pains. He did note that on Monday he noticed a slight erythema on the glans of his penis, which sometimes is a first sign of his genital herpes. He denied any pain in his legs or evidence of cellulitis.  


In the ED he was febrile to 102.1 and rest of VSS. He was given Vanc, ceftriaxone and Acylovir. He was admitted and was continued on vancomycin and doxycycline and then cultures returned positive today for 4/4 GPC in chains. Cardiology was consulted and recommended TTE/TEE. Repeat cultures were drawn on 7/27.  


PMH 

-Endocarditis (1989): after sustaining a foot laceration in Guatemala. Underwent aortic and mitral mechanical valve replacement and been on Coumadin.  Unknown pathogen.  

-Gram negative endocarditis secondary to Neisseria elongata in 1995 with L septic knee. He underwent I+D at MGH.  Workup with TEE showed question of small vegetation, but no valvular insufficiency.  He was treated with several months of Ceftriaxone and Gentamicin.

64M with PMH of endocarditis s/p mechanical mitral and aortic valve replacement in 1989, hep C cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) s/p Bi-V ICD 2008, A-fib, Burkitts lymphoma now in remission, and two episodes of bacteremia [group B strep bacteremia (s/p 2 weeks IV Ceftriaxone in Sept 2012) and S. mitis bacteremia in 11/12 (s/p 6 weeks of IV Ceftriaxone given concern of possible SC septic joint though Cx remained negative)] recently stopped chronic suppressive oral PCN therapy in June who presents with fevers and found to have 4/4 GPC in chains in his blood.  


Most likely source of his initial group B strep bacteremia back in September 2012 was from cellulitis and then it is unclear how he became infected with the Strep Mitis back in 11/2012. He has been doing well on suppressive therapy, but unfortunately Strep mitis is known to infect valves/leads (which he has both of.) There was no evidence back in 11/2012 of endocarditis, but one explanation is that he had mild infection on these leads and then was suppressed on the PO PCN and when he stopped he had a high grade bacteremia again. Depending on the speciation of the 7/26 culture and the result of the TTE/TEE, we will have to decide with cardiology/EP about whether his ICD/pacemaker leads will have to be removed. And there are no further diagnostics to do at this point given that he has no other visible sources (no back pain to suggest osteo or dental abscess.) In terms of treatment would continue Vancomycin and also add back Ceftriaxone, which will have better strep coverage than Vanc. And then when we get final sensitivities back we can narrow and likely stop the Vancomycin. In terms of tick related infections, they are much less likely and given that we have an etiology you can stop the doxycycline for now. And lyme will be covered regardless by ceftriaxone although anaplasma will not (but our suspicion for this is low given documented high grade bacteremia and his leukopenia is old and not a new process.) 


Recommendations:  agree with TTE and if negative to perform TEE f/u final speciation of bcx on 7/26 daily blood cultures until clears stop doxycycline Continue Vancomycin Start Ceftriaxone 2gram IV daily

Fever and headache 

HPI 

Mr. Murphy is a 64 yo M with a history of endocarditis in 1989, leading to MVR and AVR, HCV 2/2 blood transfusion in 1989 during valve repair, CHF (EF 35%), Burkitt's lymphoma s/p chemo 2011 (now in remission), and two episodes of bacteremia [group B strep bacteremia (s/p 2 weeks IV Ceftriaxone in Sept 2012) and S. mitis bacteremia (s/p 6 weeks of IV Ceftriaxone given concern of possible SC septic joint though Cx remained negative)], and genital HSV, who now presents with fever.  5 days PTA, he felt chills in the evening.  He took his temp and it was 100.  The following day he felt fine.  The following two days, he again experienced chills and temps of 100.  Then, the day of admission, he had a temp to 102.8.  Also on the day of admision, he had a headache that was relieved by ibuprofen.  He also noticed a non-painful, non-pruitic, red rash on the glans penis.  The only other symptom revealed on ROS is bilateral knee pain that has been intermittent for the past few days.  He denies swelling or erythema.  He has no other focal signs of infection (cough, rhinorrhea, n/v/d, abdominal pain, dysuria).   


His recent medical history is notable for being placed on PCN ppx following two episodes of cellulitis leading to bacteremia and an ICU admission.  About 3 weeks ago, he stopped taking the PCN and decided to take an herbal supplement called Silver Shield which reportedly is a "natural antibiotic".  


In the ED: He had a fever to 102.1, HR 64, BP 123/64, RR 16, O2 97% on RA.  His CMP was normal other than a Na of 130.  U/A, LA, Ammonia, Lipase, CK, Trop were normal.  CBC showed his baseline neutropenia and thrombocytopenia: WBC 3.29, Hct 33, Plt 56.  INR was 2.  Blood and urine cultures were sent.  Head CT and CXR were normal.  He was started on Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir.

Assessment/Plan 

Mr. Murphy is a 64 yo M with a h/o endocarditis, s/p AVR and MVR, Burkitt's lymphoma in remission, HCV cirrhosis, and recent cellulitis and bacteremia who is presenting with fever and headache.  The constellation of fever, headache, and conjuntivitis, arthraliga, and rash suggests viral etiology (eg adenovirus).  Although he has h/o HSV, suspicion for HSV encephalitis is low, given normal MS, no focal neurologic sigs, no hemorrhage on head CT.  Viral meningitis is also possible, and typically does not require treatment.  His murmur has been noted in the past, and thus is not evidence for endocarditis.  However, he is high risk with two prosthetic valves and a history of bacteremia.  Finally, he is also high risk for tick born infections, thay may present with vague symptoms such as headache, fever, arthralgia.   


# Fever 

- Emperic treat with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Doxycline for broad coverage of bacteremia and tick born infections 

- Blood culture pending 

- Lyme Ab, Babesia smear, Anaplasma Ab, and Ehlichia/Anaplasma PCR 

- Daily exam for evidence of endocarditis 


# Afib, prosthetic valve 

- Continue coumadin, goal INR 2-3 

- Continue Digoxin 


# Edema 

- Continue home spironolactone and torsemide

Dear Drs. Hollett, LaCasce, O'Gara, Price, Dr. Sax: 


We had the pleasure of seeing Paul Murphy in hepatology clinic for followup of his hepatitis C and cirrhosis.  He was last seen in our clinic in January 2013.  Since that time, he has unfortunately had a second bout sof bactremia requiring hospitalization.   He has fortunately recovered well, and is feeling relatively well today.   


In regard to his liver disease, he denies any recent jaundice or ascites.  He does have some leg edema, which has recently been relatively stable and not too bad.  He denies any recent changes to his diuretics.  He denies any rectal bleeding or melena.  He denies any confusion or difficultly sleeping.  He had an US prior to seeing us today as part of his HCC screening.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 64-year-old man with a complicated medical history including hepatitis C and cirrhosis.  


1.  HCV:  As discussed his last visit, his history of heart failure, episodes of bactermia as a contraindication for the use of interferon-based therapies, which is all that is currently available for treatment of hepatitis C.  We will consider treatment with non-interferon based therapies when they are available. 


2.  Cirrhosis:  No evidence of recent decompensation despite his recent medical issues. He is on diuretics for his heart failure. His upper endoscopy in August 2011 did not show any evidence of varices.  We will consider a repeat endoscopy in the future to evaluate for development of varices.   


3.  HCC screening: US today, sub-centimeter cyst seen. Will have another in 6 months. Already scheduled. 


4.  Routine maintenance:  He has had two doses of hepatitis B vaccination.  He has a positive hepatitis A Ab. He denies use of alcohol and tobacco.  He has had a relatively recent LFTs, CBC, albumin, and renal function.  We will therefore hold off on obtaining these today, and anticipate that he will have labs done again in the near future. 


5. Alternative medicine: Informed of potential of additional hepatic injury from supplements.  

We will see him back in 6 months.  


Thank you for involving us in this patient's care. 


Sincerely,

  This 64-year-old man with history of streptococcal bacteremia is seen for followup.  He has decided to stop preventive penicillin therapy, and switch to a holistic medication given his fear about chronic antibiotic use.  We have explained in detail that we believe the overall benefits for him, given his prosthetic valve, outweigh the risks.  Nonetheless, he is adamant about stopping the penicillin. 


He was counseled to seek prompt attention for any illness consistent with cellulitis or bacteremia, and also was counseled about strategies to avoid Lyme disease given his living in a highly endemic area. 


Patient's and his wife's questions answered. 


Patient was seen and evaluated with Dr. Price, whose history, exam, and plan I have confirmed.

CC: Strep mitis bacteremia  


HPI:  64M with PMH of endocarditis s/p MVR and AVR in 1989, hep C cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) s/p Bi-V ICD 2008, A-fib, Burkitts lymphoma now in remission, and two episodes of bacteremia [group B strep bacteremia (s/p 2 weeks IV Ceftriaxone in Sept 2012) and S. mitis bacteremia (s/p 6 weeks of IV Ceftriaxone given concern of possible SC septic joint though Cx remained negative)] now on chronic suppressive therapy with oral PCN.  

At last visit, the pt and his wife again questioned the need for ongoing PCN and we spent time explaining that the PCN suppression is to try and prevent infections with things like group B strep (which he had in Sept 2012) that can cause a rapid onset cellulitis (+/- bacteremia) given his prosthetic valves and PPM. 


Today the pt states that he has decided he will stop taking PCN and he has already started taking an herbal supplement called Silver Shield which reportedly is a "natural antibiotic".  We explained that it would not be our recommendation to stop the PCN but he is free to choose what he feels is best.  We also spent time explaining that non-FDA approved medicines/supplements are not regulated and thus we do not know the risks and side effects that such a medicine could have.  I did encourage him to let all his other physicians know that this is a new supplement he is taking.

At this time, the pt has decided he does not want to continue on suppressive PCN therapy.  He has started taking a supplement called Silver Shield that is non-FDA approved and he would like to give this a try instead. 

- Pt and his wife were counseled that our recommendation would be to continue on suppressive PCN therapy, particularly with the risk a recurrent bacteremia would pose to his AVR and MVR. 

- We reminded the pt and his wife that he should seek immediate medical care at the first sign of any recurrent cellulitis OR the development of any systemic symptoms such as shaking chills, increased lethargy, fevers, sweats, etc. 


No follow-up appt needed.  Pt will call if any further questions or concerns. 


This pt was seen and discussed with preceptor Dr. Paul Sax  who agrees with above plan.

Janet, 


You last saw Mr. Murphy in clinic in February, 2013, following an admission in 11/2012 for Streptococcus mitis bacteremia.  He has a complicated medical history, as you know. Today he called to report that he is discontinuing his metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily.  He said that his blood pressure is "too low" (e.g. 110/59) and he "can't function like that".  I asked if one of his physicians had recommended discontinuing it, and he said "I'm not going to the medical profession because they'll tell me to keep taking it.  I just want to know if I have to gradually stop, because I'm not going to take it any more."  Given his decision, I advised that he should take 12.5 mg daily for 3 days before stopping, to minimize the risk of increased sympathetic activity and "rebound" elevation in blood pressure. 


If you want to discuss this with him further, he can be reached at (978) 283-3407.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

RE: ICM with EF 27-30%, CHF, evaluation for ICD versus CRT-D

Dear Dr. Klementowicz:

 Dr. Singh and I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Joseph Leto in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital today in 3 month follow up. He is a lovely 70-year-old male patient with a past medical history significant for ischemic cardiomyopathy with his first IMI in 1981 with subsequent multiple CABGs, the last being in 1999 as well as stent placement at Beth-Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His history also includes hyperreactive airway, dyslipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, and gastritis with recurrent GI bleed. 

Mr. Leto has a strong family history of sudden cardiac death. His mother died at age 36, thought to be related to coronary disease. His brother died at age 38 of SCD. His sister died at age 42 of SCD. He does not believe that any other members of his family, nor himself have had further workup regarding this family history. He has three children who are healthy. 

Mr. Leto has been followed by Dr. Klementowicz in cardiology at his Nashua office for ischemic cardiomyopathy. He underwent regadenoson sestamibi stress test 7/22/13 which showed an EF of 27% with evidence of a large region of inferoposterior lateral infarct with a very small region of basilar inferior septal ischemia. An echocardiogram performed on 7/23/13 demonstrated his ejection fraction to be 30% and the inferoposterior segments were akinetic. Given his depressed LV function and symptoms of congestive heart failure, his cardiologist recommended that be seen in consultation for a possible defibrillator versus BiV device. He also has a bone marrow deficiency with decreased red blood cells. He had been getting Procrit regularly. 

We saw him in clinic in August of this year, at which time we initially planned to implanting a CRT-D device, which we planned for mid-to-late September. Subsquently, his preprocedural blood work showed pancytopenia (WBC 2.8; Hgb 9.9; HCT 31.1, plt 129; ). Therefore procedure was halted and patient was referred to Center for Hematology for further pre-procedure evaluation of pancytompenia. He was seen by Dr. Goodarzi in Hematology who thought he was being treated appropriately with Epogen and saw no contraindication to BIV ICD placement. No formal return appointment was given to patient but was advised to have a CBC and PT/PTT done pre-procedure. He was encouraged to f/u with his local Hematologist. He has since been receiving Epogen 20,000 units weekly with subsequent increase in HCT to 35.9. 

Today in clinic he reports many of the same symptoms during his previous visit of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion, despite his HCT improving. He can walk on level ground without difficulty at a slow pace, however with any incline he becomes dyspnic. He continues to have occasional positional dizziness and is careful not to make quick position changes. He denies palpitations or recent chest pain. Has occasional swelling in his feet and ankles as well as numbness and tingling in his feet. He sleeps comfortably on one pillow and does not endorse PND or orthopnea.

Vital Signs: BMI 26.2 Overweight, moderate risk.
  Pulse 65 bpm
  resp. rate 18 BPM
  height 67 in
  weight 167 lb
  BP 110/60 mmHg

 EKG:
 11/25/13: Normal sinus rhythm at 65 bpm, PR interval 168 ms, QRS duration 160 ms, QTc 468 ms. Left axis deviation. Nonspecific intraventricular block. Inferior infarct, age undetermined. 

 Other Data:
 7/23/13: Echocardiogram (OSH) aortic root diameter 3.0 cm, LVIDS 4.9 cm, LVIDD 5.9 cm, IVSd 1.1cm. The left ventricle is mildly dilated. There is top normal wall thickness. Global left ventricular systolic flexion is markedly depressed. The estimated LVEF is 30%. There are regional wall motion abnormalities as specified. The inferior posterior segments are akinetic. There is a septal contraction abnormality suggesting conduction abnormality. The remaining walls all appear to be moderately hypokinetic as well. The LA is enlarged. The RA is normal in size. The RV is normal in size and function. The aortic valve is not well visualized. A tricuspid aortic valve appears likely. There is no AS. There is mild aortic valve insufficiency. There is mild mitral annular calcification. There is no MVP, valvular vegetation or prior rheumatic valvulitis. There is mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation. Structurally normal tricuspid valve. There is trace tricuspid regurgitation. The pulmonic valve is not well visualized. The aortic root is normal in size. 

7/22/13: LEXISCAN STRESS TEST (OSH): Rest 70. Peak HR 87, which is 58% of maximum predicted heart rate for age. Blood pressure at rest 110/60. Postexercise 128/52. Recovery 118/70. There were no diagnostic ST changes. Lexiscan stress test without induced chest discomfort. Stress EKG is without diagnostic evidence for ischemia. Sestamibi suggests a large region of inferior and posterior lateral infarct. There appears to be a very small region of basal inferior septal ischemia. There is inferior and posterior lateral wall akinesis with hypokinesis of the remaining walls. Moderate/severely reduced systolic function is suggested. The ejection fraction is calculated at 27%, though it is not clear if this is completely accurate given the difficulty tracking the inferior and posterior lateral walls. The above findings are unchanged from the patient's prior stress test on November 5, 2012. 

2/25/2011: Echocardiogram (OSH): mildly dilated left ventricle. There appears to be inferior posterior lateral wall akinesis with hypokinesis in the remaining walls. The overall systolic function appears to be severely reduced with an EF estimated at 25-30%.

Assessment and Plan: 
Joseph Leto is a pleasant 70-year-old male patient with a significant cardiac history including ischemic cardiomyopathy with multiple coronary artery bypass grafts and stent placement with recent EF noted to be 27-30% with class III heart failure symptoms, here today for evaluation for CRT-D.

Ischemic cardiomyopathy - Recent EF noted to be 27% by stress test and 30% by echocardiogram. He remains symptomatic, demonstrating class III heart failure symptoms with increasing shortness of breath with exertion. His QRS has show evidence of widening and is 160ms today. Therefore his is a good canidate for placement of a CRT-D, which we will plan for the soonest available date. We explained the procedure for CRT placement in detail as well as the need for a hospital stay and followup with the CRT clinic. We will be in touch with him regarding a procedural date. He was also given a booklet to look over explaing CRT-D devices in detail. He will be part of the DIRECT study and has met with the coordinator. If at all possible we will coordinate his CT for the study with his lab work and CXR, given the distance he lives from the hospital.
.
Coronary artery disease - Long standing history of CAD s/p multiple CABGs and stent placement. Stress test in July 2013 showed evidence of a large region of inferoposterior lateral infarct with a very small region of basilar inferior septal ischemia. Followed by Dr. Klementowicz in Nashua.

LETO, JOSEPH A   

MGH# 5161372 

DOB: 08/14/43 


10/22/13 


Reason for Visit: Patient has been referred by Dr. Singh for pre-procedure evaluation of pancytopenia. 


History of Present Illness: Patient is a 70 yo male with significant cardiac history who was recently evaluated at MGH cardiology for BIV ICD however an outside pre-op lab demonstrated pancytopenia (WBC 2.8; Hgb 9.9; HCT 31.1, plt 129;) therefore procedure was halted and patient was referred to Center for Hematology for further pre-procedure evaluation. 


I spent a fair amount of time talking to patient and reviewing his outside heme/Onc record from St. Joseph Hospital.  It is noted that patient started to experience fatigue and SOB in 12/2011 when found to have a Hb of 7. Further testing showed iron deficiency with GI work up such as colonoscopy, EGD and VCE revealed GIB from vascular ectasia.  He received multiple PRBC and IV Iron infusions (GI side effect from po Iron) and underwent frequent EGDs with fulguration to ablate the lesions by argon plasma. During this time he was noted with other cell line cytopenia for which he was evaluated by Heme/Onc Dr. Hall at St Joseph Hospital when a BM bx showed MDS.  Patient recalls extensive discussion with his physician with regard to treatment option including chemotherapy but supportive measures were preferred therefore Procrit 10,000 was started on 3/19/2013.  Unfortunately he had a period of interruption due to insurance issue when he required PRBC to support his Hb however as his insurance issue resolved, he went back on procrit once again.  Recently his dose was increased to 20.000 on 10/1/13 last dose was this morning. He states that he has not required PRBC when receiving Procrit.  He believes he has had 3 BM bx in the past most recent one in 8/2013 which was done for the purpose of insurance coverage of his procrit. 

Overall he feels well except fatigue and inability to exert himself much.

MGH: no Labs 


Assessment and Plan: 70 yo male with significant personal and family history of cardiac disease who was recently evaluated by MGH cardiology for BIV ICD, however procedure was halted due to pancytopenia noted from his outside lab. He was referred to Hematology or further pre-procedure management. 


I spent >50% of our one hour visit reviewing data with patient in details, we discussed his pancytopenia which in his case has been confirmed by multiple BM bx to be MDS/RCMD. He knows that MDS is a heterogeneous disease with certain subsets of patients surviving for a decade or more with supportive care alone. With the exception of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, MDS cannot be cured by current treatment options and the main goals of therapy for most patients are to control symptoms and to improve quality of life, which includes minimizing the toxicity of therapy. 


According to the bx report provided, his IPSS-R score is 3 (good karyotype normal, marrow blast 2-5%, Hb 8-10, Plt >100K, ANC >800) with risk category of low risk which would translate to Median survival in the absence of therapy of 5.3 yr, and 25% AML progression in the absence of therapy of 10.8 yr. Given his cardiac history and his low MDS risk category,  appropriately supportive treatment was approached with Epo. Based on NCCN guideline EPO 40,000- 60,000 U 1-3 x/wk  or Darbepoetin 150-300 mcg/wk could be considered to target hemoglobin range 10-12 not to exceed 12. His Epo has been titrated and managed by his local Hematologist as well as his need for occasional IV Iron when indicated. He knows to remain on B12 and folate as well.  His CBC does not show significant neutropenia to warrant GCSF and he has not experienced infection complications.  His plt count has been stable in 100K range and he has not had any bleeding issues.  Considering all above factors, I do not believe his MDS should be a contraindication to BIV ICD. My impression is that his cardiac condition carries a higher risk and should take priority to improve his life quality although this needs to be discussed with his cardiology further. Certainly if his cardiac procedure requires a higher plt and Hb count we can always rapidly transfuse him to a desired goal. He should also be able to recover post-procedure without significant risk of infection or wound healing.   


I reviewed all above with him, he had a good understanding of our discussion today. He knows that I will convey my findings to his cardiology and they can contact him if they decide to proceed with the procedure.  No formal return appointment was given to patient but was advised to have a CBC and PT/PTT done pre-procedure. Today we did not do any blood work as he had a CBC done this morning locally.  He was encouraged to f/u with his local Hematologist but knows to call or return for any question or concern.

 Reason for visit:
 CRT-D implant

 Interval History:
 Professor Sylvain Bromberger was seen in the Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Clinic on 05/06/2009. He is a very pleasant 84 year old gentleman with established coronary artery disease who has had a history of longstanding third-degree AV block who is S/P a Medtronic pacemaker implantation in May 2005. He has a pacemaker which is in DDR mode with a low rate of 60 and a high rate of 110 BPM, with both the atrial and the right ventricular leads having a reasonable threshold. The interrogation showed that there were no significant dysrhythmias in the background. 

Professor Bromberger came to the clinic to be evaluated for a defibrillator plus a CRT-D device. I noted after talking with him in detail that his NYHA class is between II-III, more on the class III side of things. He finds that he gets progressively short of breath with exertion and also sometimes experiences some exertional discomfort for which he has to stop. He was able to do fairly well on the 6-minute walk test today covering 1,085 feet, and his Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire score was 33. 

He recently had a coronary arterial angiogram performed in 2005 which showed significant triple-vessel disease and apparently was unamenable for any form of intervention. 

His most recent echocardiogram performed on 04/04/2009 shows an ejection fraction of 30%. His left ventricular internal diameter in diastole is 54 mm and in systole is 43 mm. His left ventricular apex is aneurysmally dilated and there is no evidence of left ventricular thrombus. He does have mild tricuspid regurgitation and a fairly dilated left atrium.

 Changes to Allergies 
NKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: [reviewed]

 Review of systems:
 Positive for shortness of breath, cough, trouble with breathing when walking, heartburn, increased frequency of urination at night, blurred vision with a right eye bad macula, dizziness, numbness, ringing in the ears, and chest pain with walking.

 Impression:
 In summary, Professor Bromberger is a very pleasant 84 year old gentleman with longstanding ischemic cardiomyopathy. He has a history of a complete high-degree block for which he had a permanent pacemaker implanted in 2005. I think he certainly meets the criteria for a CRT-D device based on the width of his QRS, his class III symptoms, and compromised ejection fraction. 

I talked at length with Professor Bromberger about the benefits of CRT. We also talked about the fact that 25% of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy may be nonresponsive to this intervention. I explained to him the details of the procedure and how we would start with a brachial venography to delineate the patency of the subclavian before proceeding with the implantation of the device from the left side. We talked about all the potential risks and complications inclusive of heart attack, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death. Professor Bromberger understands all the risks and benefist and wishes to proceed with the CRT-D implant. 

I did explain to him also different protocols that we are doing at MGH. I introduced him to both the Biomarker as well as the DIAL-CRT protocol. As part of this protocol we will arrange for him to have a femoral arterial line placed during the procedure so that we can monitor his arterial pressures as well as the cardiac output during the implant procedure so as to get an optimal right ventricular lead position.

 Reason for visit:
 Cardiac Access Unit Admit Note

 Interval History:
 Attending: Reddy

53 y/o M transferred from Beverly Hospital for further management of CHF and consideration of CRT-D. Cardiovascular history notable for:

- 1992 - STEMI -> Rx TPA followed by medical management
- 1993 - recurrent angina. Cath with multivessel CAD. Underwent CABG x 5 at St Joseph's Hospital in Baltimore, MD. Anatomy not known but per his report, both LIMA and RIMA utilized in addition to multiple vein grafts.

Did well over the ensuing 14 years without any significant limitation. However, over past 9-12 months, has noted progressive DOE. Now gets dyspneic when climbing a single flight of stairs. Occasionally gets fleeting non-exertional CP (lasting less than a few minutes) but nothing suggestive of angina. No orthopnea, PND, LE edema, palpitations, presyncope, syncope or weight gain. 

Echo over the summer apparently showed EF 25%. Started on lasix at that time with minimal improvement in dyspnea. Stress test without evidence of ischemia (details unclear). Had been referred to Dr. Reddy for consideration of CRT - outpatient appointment was scheduled for later this month. However, presented to Beverly Hospital this morning after feeling pale, sweaty and "not quite right" after climbing a flight of stairs this morning. No recent CP or CHF symptoms. At Beverly, noted to be quite hypertensive (SBP 170s) -> started on IV nitro. Echo done prior to transfer showed EF 10% but full report not sent. Transferred for further management.

Currently, resting comfortably without specific complaints. 

 Past medical history:
 - CAD as above
- ischemic CM
- HTN - per his report, BP control hasn't been very tight
- OSA on CPAP

Home meds: ASA 81, lipitor 80, zetia 10, atenolol 25, enalapril 30, lasix 20 TIW, prozac 60, folate

 Labs pending 

 Assessment and plan:
 53 y/o M with CAD, ischemic CM and NYHA class II symptoms. Cardiomyopathy is likely ischemic in nature, although uncontrolled hypertension and EtOH may have contributed to worsening symptoms over recent months. Ultimately, would likely benefit from CRT-D. However, will need to clarify status of CAD and assess if there are any revascularization options (may need viability study). 

- cycle biomarkers
- echo in AM
- obtain CABG report tomorrow
- will likely need cath to define coronary anatomy (probably on Wed). Depending on results of echo and cath, may need viability study if revascularization is an option
- needs tighter BP control: will switch atenolol to coreg and enalapril to captopril for ease of titration
- will try to wean off IV nitro overnight 
- once ACE-I is optimized, would add aldosterone antagonist
- evaluation for CRT-D

 Reason for visit:
 Presyncopal episode 

 Interval History:
 Mr. Arsenault is a 70 y.o male w/ a history of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, EF 31% by TTE 1 yr ago, NYHA class II/III symptoms, now admitted w/ a presyncopal episode this morning. He reports being his USOH until this morning when he noted acute onset of lethargy, diaphorsis and dyspnea while driving. He then was able to stop his truck, exit the vehicle and sit down, but had continued weakness and diaphoresis. EMS was called and on arrival noted his HR to be 38 w/ frequent ectopy and he received a lidocaine bolus w/ initiation of a drip as well. Lidocaine was not continued on his admission to Ellison 10. 

Prior to todays event, Mr. Arenault had seen Dr. Heist for evaluation for biventricular ICD. He reports that over the past several months, he had some decrease activity tolerance, but overall has been feeling well. He continues to work and 8 hour day; he reports stable weights, denies orthopnea, PND, LE edema. He reported chronic cough likely felt secondary to lisinopril and was switched to ARB on his recent office visit. A recent holter monitor was also done and revealed 25% ventricular ectopy.

 Assessment and plan:
 70-year-old gentleman with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, EF 31%, recent slight decline in activity tolerance, signficant ventricular ectopy on recent holter now admitted w/ pre-syncopal event and noted to be bradycardic w/ HR 38 and confirmed significant ventricular ectopy. Cardiac markers are negative thus far and based on past coronary angiogram w/o significant coronary disease, there is low suspicion of an ischemic contribution. In the setting that he is planned for device placement, we would plan for a functional study to confirm no evidence of ischemic contribution and would get an adenosine MIBI tomorrow if cardiac markers are negative X 3 sets. 

Based on his borderline EF, significant ventricular ectopy, placement of an ICD device should be prioritzed as well as evaluation by the EP team for Bi-V device. Dr. Heist has been consulted to evaluate for device placement. for management of arrythmia and HF, please continue beta-blockade of Coreg 25mg PO BID, starting 6/15 as he has taken Coreg CR and valsartan this AM. Please also resume his valsartan (beginning 6/15); hold for systolic less than 100. If marginal blood pressures, please prioritize beta-blockade and hold ARB. 

There is no evidence of volume overload on exam, so no need for lasix at this time. Please continue low dose aldactone as you are as well as ASA and statin for CAD. 

Other plans per Dr. Moore.

He reports he was feeling well this morning, and while he was driving his truck, becan to feel weak, lightheaded, SOB and sweaty. He drove to his garage where he was able to walk out of his truck to the garage and sat in a chair. he had loss of urinary continence, but never passed out and was alert and responsive for the entire event. Symptoms lasted for about 15 minutes. He denies having CP now or for any of this episode. EMS found him alert and responsive but with a HR of 38, which increased spontaneously to 100 with IV placement. He was noted to have frequent PVCs and couplets, bigeminy and was bolused with lidocaine and placed on a lidocaine drip. He currently reports he feels completely asymptomatic, denying SOB, CP, lighheadedness or palpitations. Followed by Dr. Moore and Dr. Heist. [lg59]

CC: Presyncope 


HPI: Mr. Arsenault is a 70y/o gentleman with a h/o NYHA Class II/III DCM EF 31%, currently undergoing evaluation for an ICD based on EF and recent Holter with significant polymorphic ventricular ectopy (~1/4 of beats).  He was in his USOH until this morning when, while driving, he suddenly became weak, diaphoretic, short of breath and lightheaded like he might pass out.  He parked his truck in his work garage, and was able to get out of the truck, ambulate inside.  He was helped to a chair by his son, who noted him to look pale and diaphoretic. He felt progressively weak and became incontinent of urine.  He states he never frankly passed out, and was responsive the entire time.  He never had any chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath.  No witnessed sz activity per his son. 


EMS was called, and found him responsive but groggy, with HR of 38 which increased to 100bpm with IV placement but no pharmacologic intervention.  He was noted to have frequent PVCs, bigeminy and couplets, bloused with 100mg IV lidocaine and started on a lidocaine drip in the field. 


In the ED, VS were unremarkable (HR 80, BP 94/55) and physical examination was unremarkable. ECG was unchanged from prior and CXR was unremarkable.  Cardiac biomarkers were negative, and his BNP was only mildly elevated (1774pg/mL).  He is admitted to the SDU for continuous cardiac telemetry, evaluation for possible ACS and possible an ICD.

CXR: Clear 


Impression and Plan: 70y/o M p/w presyncopal episode.  Based on his history, this is concerning for dysrhythmia likely ventricular in origin vs possible ACS.  A neurologic event is possible, however the event was witness, the patient, witness and EMS noted no neurologic deficits or seizure activity, and he was bradycardic at the scene.  His lack of tachycardia, CP, hypoxemia or stigmata of DVT make PE less likely. 

- CV rhythm: Continuous cardiac telemetry for now. Will d/w Dr Heist who has followed the pt re possible ICD placement this hospitalization. Will hold off on lidocaine for now with low threshold to restart if develops NSVT/VT. 


- CV ischemia: Less likely ischemia but will cycle biomarkers. AdenoMIBI this admission given uninterpretable ECG if rules out.  ASA, Crestor, Coreg. Check lipids and A1C. 


- CV pump: EF 31%. Appears euvolemic on exam w/o symptoms of CHF. Daily weights and Is+Os. Continue Aldactone, ARB for ventricular remodeling.

 Impression:
 This is a 70-year-old gentleman with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, EF 30%, class II to III stage C. I would consider him a candidate for biventricular ICD based on some newer symptoms of decreased exercise tolerance and some mild edema. We will start him on Aldactone 12.5 mg daily. I have discontinued his ACE inhibitor and started him on Diovan 160 mg daily. He will see me again in one month with an echo and also will followup with Dr. Heist.

In brief; 35 yo female w/ severe systolic dysfunction 2/2 Chagas CM s/p ICD, AMI w/ embolic event in 2010, several recent heart failure exacerbations at BMC presented to MGH ER yesterday for 'second opinion' in regards to advanced therapies. Most recent admission earlier this year was complicated by cardiogenic shock and spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus requiring inotropic therapy. Her RHC data close to presumed dry weight reported as CO 4.1, SVR of 1033, MVO2 53. Discharge weight 54 kg on low dose lasix, dig and hydral. Her last TTE on 02/28/15 includes an EF of 10%), LVIDD 73, RVSP 35 mm Hg, mod to sev MR, mild to mod TR, significant RV hypokinesis.

Reportedly, patient followed at BMC cardiology department intermittently follow up as outpatient. Her systolic function became after the delivery of her first baby 2 years ago, transplant listing was jeopardized at that point of time due to her illegal status in the US. Patient never received treatment for her Chagas. Based on reports from her primary cardiologist, patient was also not considered to be good candidate for DT LVAD placement. Apparently, patient lacked insight in the severity of the disease. 

Her physicians indicate that the patient has not shown much insight. Although BMC does not have a program of advanced therapies it is thought the she would not be a good VAD candidate as destination therapy might be a dead end and moreover that the patient would not be able to manage it. She does not seem to understand the severity of the disease and her insight is poor (Jennifer Ho 617 638-8700).

PROBLEM: Pretransplant metabolic bone evaluation 


HPI: Ms. Ortiz is a 35 yo woman spaniosh-speaking woman with Chagas Disease cardiomyopathy who is in for a pre-transplant evaluation. We are called to evaluate for any metabolic bone disease as she will potentially lose bone after transplant and with immunosuppresive therapy. 


In January she was admitted to Boston Medical Center where her course was complicated by cardiogenic shock, shock liver, and spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus. She has had many heart failure exacerbations. She is gravida 7 Para 3. 


No known osteoporosis or other bone problems. No history of fractures. No supplemental calcium or vitamin D. Exercise is limited by her cardiac status.

Impression: 

1. No evidence of metabolic bone disease  

2. Low vitamin D level 

3. Chagas Disease with cardiomyopathy 

4. Pre heart transplant evaluation 

5. Mild elevation of parathyroid hormone like secondary to low vitamin D level. 


Suggest: 

1. Should get the vitamin D level into the normal range. Would give vitamin D 50,000 international units PO daily for 5 days and then follow with vitamin D3 2000 international units PO daily. 

2. Aim for total calcium intake (food plus supplements) in the 1000-1200 mg range. If need calcium supplements would go with calcium citrate since she is on a proton pump inhibitor. 

3. Bone density as per protocol.

Infectious Disease Diagnosis:   

1. Chagas Cardiomyopathy 


Brief History: 

Ms Ortiz is a 35 y/o woman from El Salvador with Chagas cardiomyopathy s/p AICD and subsequent NYHA-II heart failure with recent decompositions requiring admission at BMC (1/2/15-1/14/15) for cardiogenic shock resulting in shock liver and spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus, who was admitted to MGH on 2/17 with worsening heart failure and is now being evaluated for heart transplant.  


She suffered a thromboembolic acute anterior STEMI in 2010. She has suffered a number of heart failure exacerbations thought to be due to non-compliance. She was diagnosed with Chagas in 8/2011 with confirmatory serologies by CDC. She was followed by Drs. Manish Sagar and Laura Chamberlain form ID at BMC. She was evaluated for treatment by the CDC and was accepted. An IND was filled and benznidazole was obtained but she never followed up. Each time she presented to medical care she was either pregnant or breast-feeding so treatment was never pursued.  


This exacerbation was caused by influenza dx at OSH s/p oseltamavir. She is currently being evaluated for heart transplant. Current guidelines do not recommend pre-transplant Benzinadazole; however, she will need close monitoring post transplant and may require treatment at that time.  


She received ivermectin X 2 doses. She received Flu, TDaP, Hep B #1 (high dose), and Prevnar (PCV-13). Her IGRA was negative for TB. 


Pre-transplant screening results: 

MMR  immune 

HAV  immune 

CMV IgG: equivocal 

Toxoplasma: Negative 

HCV: Negative 

HBsAg: Negative 

HBsAb: Negative 

GC/Chlamydia: Negative 

Trep Sure: Negative 

HIV: Negative 


1. Please notify Transplant ID if she is listed for transplant so we can contact the CDC to procure possible treatment post transplant.  


2. Please re-consult transplant ID at time of transplant for monitoring and treatment of Chagas disease.  


Vaccinations: 

She will require Hep B #2 (high dose 40 mcg) in 8 weeks. 

She will require pneumovax (PPV-23) in 8 weeks 


Suggested laboratory monitoring and frequency:   

1.  Safety monitoring of antibiotic therapy: None 


2. Diagnostic studies related to ID consult still pending at the time of discharge: 

            -EGD / Barium swallow 

            -Schisto Ab 

            -Strongloides Ab 

            -Coccidio

 Ms. Ortiz is a Spanish speaking 35 yo female,Blood group A, with Chagas induced cardiomyopathy now admitted for HF management and cardiac transplant evaluation.She is a 35 year old woman with NYHA Class 2 Heart Failure due to primary Chagas Cardiomyopathy (Dual Chamber AICD; dry weight 54 kg) who was recently admitted to Boston Medical Center (1/2 to 1/14) where her course was complicated by cardiogenic shock, shock liver, and spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus requiring inotropic therapy. She has had many heart failure exacerbations. However, during her most recent and most severe heart failure admission at BMC she had a spontaneous abortion. (She is gravida 7 Para 3) and developed shock liver with hepatocellular enzymes in exceess of 3800 (greater than the BMC assay). A RHC had a CO of 1.8, CI 1.1, SVR 2741, MVO2 31 and PCWP of 23. She was treated with milrinone and dobutamine gtt with captopril, digoxin, and hydralazine. Her RHC pressures would improve with CO 4.1, SVR of 1033, MVO2 53. Her course was further c/b significant ventricular ectopy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  

Please see admission note for details of Maria Ortiz's presentation.  


In brief, Ms. Ortiz is a 35 year old female with CAD, NYHA-IV CHF (2/2 Chagas Cardiomyopathy) with dual chamber AICD (dry weight 54 kg) who usually gets care at BMC (by Claudia Hochberg; 781-927-4788, 617-953-2734, email: claudia.hochberg@bmc.org) who was recently admitted to BMC (1/2 to 1/14) for cardiogenic shock in the setting of being pregnant (with resulting spontaneus abortion of a 19 week fetus) presenting here for heart failure evaluation and currently undergoing cardiac transplant workup.  


SDU course 2/18/15  2/25/15: 

-We got a TTE with 10% EF, BiV failure with mod to severe MR and mod TR. Her blood pressures were originally high 80s to los 90s systolic, was mentating, warm extremities and had a lactate of 3.3 that has since downtrended to stable 2.5.  

-We consulted heart failure for evaluation for advanced therapies or cardiac transplant. We have been diuresing her since her dry weight is closer to 54Kg (119lbs), and she came in with 126lbs, +JVD up to neck and abdominal distention/nausea and bloating.  

-She was on home torsemide 5mg QD when she first came in. We have escalated this to 80mg of IV lasix BID for TBB of at least negative 1.5L. She is still undergoing workup for heart transplant. Gynecology was consulted on 2/24 to talk to her about contraceptives. 

-On 2/26, she got mexplanon contraceptive implanted in her arm. 


She received ivermectin dose for empiric tx of strongyloides and serology was sent. On 2/24 PM, metolazone 2.5mg x1 was added to regimen to help her diurese further, as she has more abdominal distention and nausea, likely due to high filling pressures. 

-2/25: Transferred to Cardiac surgery as a CCU Border 


Cardiac surgery 2/25/15  3/1/15: 

She had a RHC on 2/25. CI was 1.98, PAP 42/17, PCWP 21.  

Milrinone was started at 0.3 and increased to 0.4 on 2/26 for a low CI.  

She was been diuresed with IV Torsemide, Lasix and Metolazone.  

The PA line was d/c'ed on 2/27 once on stable inotropic dose support.  

She is maintained on Aldactone and is on PO Torsemide. Lisinopril was stopped for low blood pressures. 

A PICC line was placed on 2/28 and the introduced was removed.  

Transplant workup is going. 

- if listed for transplant, receiving tx for benznidazole for chronic Chagas disease (from CDC). Dr. Sager (at BMC) would arrange for this drug as an outpatient.  

-Has 5 beat run of NSVT today (3/1/15) 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 

1. Hypertension
2. CHF NYHF Class 4
3. She presented in October of 2010 with chest pain and anterior STEMI and underwent coronary angiography revealing 40% mid stenosis and distal occlusion of the LAD. Ventriculogram revealed apical ballooning with EF 0.45 out of proportion to the LAD occlusion. No intervention was performed.

HOSPITAL COURSE AND PLAN: 


Ms. Ortiz is a 35 year old female with NYHA-IV CHF (2/2 Chagas Cardiomyopathy) with dual chamber AICD, who presents with decompensated heart failure, now on stable dose milrinone, undergoing heart transplant evaluation. 


# Decompensated systolic heart failure 2/2 Chagas: on stable dose milrinone, currently euvolemic  

Preload: 

- home dose torsemide 5 mg po daily 

Afterload: 

-add aldactone 12.5mg daily 

- lisinopril 5 mg po daily will hold today based on lower-than usual SBP 80mmHg 

with bowel prep ongoing, no room for further uptitration 

-c/w digoxin 

- milrinone dependant, tolerating 0.4 w/ adequate CI, PICC line in place for home 

therapy which will serve as a trial period for evaluating OHT candidacy as well 

- It is worth considering CRT-D despite stage IV symptoms (ENHANCE HF) 

particularly if she is deemed to be a OHT candidate as we will be supporting her 

while awaiting OHT 

-needs standing scale weights daily 


# Chagas disease 

- appreciate ID input 

- no plans for Chagas therapeutics, currently clinical guidelines dont recommend pre treatment with benzanidazole 

-if OHT is offered, we will monitor her for parasitemia. if positive, proceed with treatment at that time. No indication to treat at this time 

- EGD/colo on 3/2 


# Dyspepsia: may be related to Chagas disease vs GERD 

-Obtain barium swallow 

-GI evaluation with EGD/colo 


# Orthotopic heart transplant evaluation: medically, no obvious contrainidications to transplant workup. plan for another family meeting on Monday to discuss current health condition and prognosis  

- social worker involved 

- endo input 

- PFTs and bone scan pending 

- f/u pap smear path 

-HIV and HTLV serologies pending 

-Urine histo pending 

-Vaccines: TDap (2/27), PCV 13 (2/27), Hepatitis B (2/28); influenza (2/27) 

-Contraception: did receive nexplanon 2/26 

-Dental: If patient to be discharged prior to surgery, we recommend comprehensive dental evaluation including complete set of dental intraoral radiographs with LDMD. 


# Anemia (chronic dz/iron deficiency): 

- transition to IV iron in light of her profound Fe deficiency, anemia, and our desire to avoid giving her blood products 


# Nutrition, pre alb 5: 

- Needs aggressive supplements, evaluated by nutrition service 


# Low protein C, low protein S, low AT III: presumably hypercoagulation studies sent for fetal loss 

-consider consulting heme for assistance with interpreting these results in light of her transplant evaluation 

# CV-ischemia: She presented in October of 2010 with chest pain and anterior STE changes on EKG and underwent coronary angiography revealing 40% mid stenosis and distal occlusion of the LAD. Ventriculogram revealed apical ballooning with EF 0.45 out of proportion to the LAD occlusion. No intervention was performed as this was an embolic event. 

-No need for ASA or statin 


# CV-Rhythm: Has ACID (lower limit 60, upper 140). 
-Monitor on telemetry
-K>4, Mg >2 

Prophylaxis: DVT->heparin ppx; GI prophylaxis none ; Bowel regimen PRN

History of present illness:
35F w/ PMHx significant for CHF (previously NYHA Class II, 2/2 Chagas Cardiomyopathy with dual chamber AICD), HTN, CAD (anterior STEMI 2010; no intervention), HTN and recent hospitalization at BMC for cardiogenic shock, shock liver and spontaneous abortion (19wk fetus), who was admitted to MGH on 2/18 for the management of CHF.

During her hospitalization at BMC, she had a spontaneous abortion and shock liver. RHC CO of 1.8, CI 1.1, SVR 2741, MVO2 31 and PCWP of 23. She was treated with milrinone and transitioned to a dobutamine gtt with captopril, digoxin, and hydralazine. Her RHC improved with CO 4.1, SVR of 1033, MVO2 53. Her course was further c/b signifigant ventricular ectopy. She was discharged on 40 mg of intravenous lasix and a dobutamine gtt. Her doctors describe a lack of insight and misunderstanding of the etiology of her demise in part of the patient.

TTE on 01/07/15 w/EF of 0.21 (biplane), LVIDD 80, RVSP 38 mm Hg. She has biatrial enlargement with septal bowing to the right. There was moderate to severe MR and mild to moderate TR.

She also had a recent hospitalization at Whidden Hospital for influenza and completed tx. In the ED she had a some NSVT. CXR with cardiomegaly and no acute abnormality, BNP 7K, trop neg x2, lactate 34.7->2.6, Cr 1.04, INR 1.5, ALT 126, AST 153 (reporteldly as high as 3K at OSH).

Since admission to MGH on 2/18/15, she has been diuresed with IV Torsemide, Lasix and Metolazone. She received Ivermectin for empiric treatment of strongyloides on 2/23 and 2/25. She had a Mexplanon contraceptiv implant placed on 2/26 after being granted an exception by a catholic priest. She had a RHC on 2/25. CI was 1.98, PAP 42/17, PCWP 21. Milrinone was started at 0.3 and increased to 0.4 on 2/26 for a low CI. The PA line was d/c'ed on 2/27. She is maintained on Lisinopril and is on PO Torsemide. A PICC line was placed on 2/28 and the introducer was removed. She's now scheduled for EGD/colonoscopy as pre-transplant workup.

MITRAL VALVE 
There is no evidence of mitral valve prolapse. There is incomplete closure of
the mitral valve leaflets c/w papillary muscle displacement. There is moderate
to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler. Pulmonary venous
Doppler systolic flow velocity is blunted c/w elevated LA pressure.

LEFT ATRIUM 
The left atrium is elongated. The antero-posterior left atrial dimension is 36
mm (normal range: up to 38 mm). The medial-lateral left atrial dimension is 39
mm (normal range: up to 49 mm). The superior-inferior left atrial dimension is
59 mm (normal range: up to 53 mm).

AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT 
There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis. The aortic valve is
tricuspid. There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral
Doppler. The aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva is 28 mm (normal: less
than 40mm). The ascending aorta diameter above the sinotubular junction is 26
mm (normal: less than or equal to 36mm).

LEFT VENTRICLE 
The left ventricular cavity size is dilated. The left ventricular systolic
function is impaired. The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic. There is
no evidence of left ventricular thrombus. The estimated ejection fraction is
10 %. LVEF was measured by the single dimension method.

TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC 
There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of moderate tricuspid
insufficiency. There is right atrial dilatation. There is a pacemaker wire
noted in the right heart.

PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A. 
There is evidence of moderate pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral
Doppler. The RV systolic pressure was estimated from the regurgitant tricuspid
velocity (assuming an RA pressure of 10mmHg). The estimated RV systolic
pressure is 35 mmHg.

RIGHT VENTRICLE 
The right ventricle is dilated. The right ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic.

PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES 
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion. There is no
echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. There is ascites.

CONCLUSIONS 

There are no prior MGH echo exams.

Procedure: 
Placement of a Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheter (PICC) under sonographic guidance.  


Procedure Date/Time: 02/28/2015  


Ordering Provider: Williams, Jennifer NP  


Clinician(s): G. Kim RN  


Monitor(s): S. Duffy IVT  


Diagnosis: Cardiomypathy, CHF  


Reason for PICC: Medications  


Device: 
Bard PICC 5 French x 37 cm DL lumen polyurethane catheter  


Procedure Description:  

The risks, benefits and alternatives of PICC placement were discussed with the patient and/or patients family, and informed written consent was obtained. The patients RIGHT arm BASILIC vein was assessed and deemed acceptable for placement. The intended insertion site was marked with a surgical marker, labeled YES, and external measurements were performed to estimate the catheter length required to allow the PICC tip to terminate in the SVC. The patients RIGHT arm was then prepped and then draped using standard sterile technique. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including cap and mask, sterile gown, sterile gloves, large sterile sheet, hand hygiene and 2% Chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis. A Universal Protocol timeout procedure was performed and checklist completed per MGH protocol.  


After local anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine  3 mls given intradermally, the RIGHT arm BASILIC vein was punctured with a 21 gauge (0.9 mm) x 7 cm echogenic needle under sonographic guidance and the 0.018 (0.46 mm) x 50 cm nitinol guidewire was easily introduced to the 20 cm mark. The 21 gauge needle was exchanged for a peel away sheath microintroducer and the guidewire was removed from the patients body. The guidewire was inspected and was fully intact. The DL lumen PICC catheter was trimmed to a length of 37 cm and introduced through the sheath 36 cm (1 cm left externally) without resistance or difficulty.  


After advancing the catheter the desired length and the lumen(s) aspirated blood briskly, the peel-away sheath was removed and was terminally flushed with 0 mL of 10 units/mL heparinized saline solution. Catheter was secured with a StatLock adhesive device and the catheter-skin junction was covered with a sterile Biopatch (Chlorhexidine impregnated sponge) and a sterile transparent occlusive tegaderm dressing. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication. Procedure observed by the monitor, an IV therapy technician who completed the Central Line Insertion: Infection Prevention Checklist. RN caring for patient is aware that this line cannot be used until x-ray confirms placement. The On-Call Critical Care Intensivist covering the Post Anesthesia Care Unit was immediately available for entire procedure.  


Terminal Tip Location:  

To be determined by A/P chest film  


Baseline Measurements:  


Total Catheter Length= 37 cm  


Indwelling Catheter Length= 36 cm  


External Catheter Length = At the 1 CM MARK

Conclusion: 
Successful placement of a 5 French x 37 cm DL lumen PICC via the RIGHT arm BASILIC vein approach.

REASON FOR CONSULT:  pre-heart transplant work-up and dysphagia  


[Spanish speaking only, IPOP used at bedside for translation] 

HPI:   Ms Ortiz is a 35 y/o woman from El Salvador with Chagas cardiomyopathy s/p AICD and subsequent NYHA-II heart failure with recent decompositions requiring admission at BMC (1/2/15-1/14/15) for cardiogenic shock resulting in shock liver and spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus, who was admitted to MGH on 2/17 with worsening heart failure and is now being evaluated for heart transplant. 


GI was consulted for pre-transplant evaluation with colonoscopy and further evaluation of dysphagia. Patient reports that for the past year she has been experiencing difficulty swallowing solids, specifically chicken more than anything. She explains this sensation comes and goes but has been worsening over the past month. In addition she experiences heartburn that has been worsening as well. Occasionally she will experience some nausea/vomiting with meals as well as regurgitation of food that she will spit out if it comes back up into her mouth. No difficulty with liquids. She reports that she has lost 23 lbs over the past year but of note she delivered one of her babies one year ago.  In addition she has baseline constipation. A good week for her is a BM everyday but when she becomes constipated she can go three days without a BM. No report of BRBPR but occasional dark colored stool. No abdominal pain. No previous endoscopies.  


MEDICAL HISTORY/SURGICAL HISTORY: 

Chagas Disease  confirmed by CDC 

-Associated cardiomyopathy with NYHF Class 2 

CAD: s/p anterior STEMI 2010and 

-underwent coronary angiography revealing 40% mid stenosis and distal occlusion of the LAD. Ventriculogram revealed apical ballooning with EF 0.45 out of proportion to the LAD occlusion. No intervention was performed.

ASSESSMENT  PLAN 


Impression: This is a 35 y/o F from El Salvador with Chagas cardiomyopathy s/p AICD and subsequent NYHA-II heart failure with recent decomposition who was admitted to MGH on 2/17 with worsening heart failure and is now being evaluated for heart transplant. She has never had endoscopic evaluation before and will require a colonoscopy as a part of her heart transplant work-up. In addition she presents with a one year history of heartburn and intermittent dysphagia associated with solids that has become progressively worse over the past month. Her current symptoms are reflective of a mechanical obstruction such as from a lower esophageal ring or peptic stricture buwWhat is interesting about her case is that she was diagnosed with Chagas disease in 2011 which has major manifestations of cardiomyopthy which she presents with and gastrointestinal disease which seems highly likely in this case with her history of dysphagia and constipation. Although she doesnt complain of dysphagia with liquids she does endorse some coughing with the ingestion of food which is also concerning for early signs of achalasia. Chagas disease is caused by T. cruzi which destroys the myenteric plexus of the esophagus which has been associated with altered motor dysfunction and relaxation of the LES. Patient will undergo EGD/Colonoscopy for further evaluation. Please obtain a barium swallow to further assess for achalasia.  


Recommendations: 

- Plan for EGD and Colonoscopy for further evaluation, Plan for Monday 3/2/2015 with cardiac anesthesia  

- Please start patient on clear liquid diet Saturday 2/28 

- Please see GI RN, Sarah Keegan, note in LMR for colo prep instruction 

- Please obtain barium swallow to further assess for achalasia.  

- Continue on Omeprazole 40mg PO daily

Case reviewed in detail with Stephanie Doherty. I have reviewed the relevant laboratory data. I have interviewed and examined the patient. I agree with Stephanie Doherty's assessment and recommnedations. 


Mrs. Ortiz is from El Salvador and has a history of Chagas disease-related cardiomyopathy. We are consulted for a pretransplant colonoscopy.  Her history is notable for laxative-dependent constipation over the past 3 years and intermittent, progressive dysphagia for solids>liquids, with heartburn, reflux, and nocturnal cough/regurgitatiion. Her exam is notable for soft, nontender abdomen, without hepatosplenomegaly.   


Her history of dysphagia raises the possibility of secondary achalasia due to Chagas disease.  It is important to determine whether she has achalasia before her transplant because, if present and untreated, it could pose a significant aspiration risk. In addition to the esophagus, Chagas disease can also affect the colon, sometimes resulting in Hirschsprung's disease-like abnormalities due to involvement of the myenteric plexus with T. cruzi. Her constipation may be on this basis. She is scheduled for a colonoscopy.  Would also perform an EGD to evaluate her dysphagia. She should have an esophageal motiity study to exclude achalasia. A barium swallow would also be useful to assess for achalasia.

Met with patient after reviewing chart and discussing plan of care with inpatient GI consult team. Vpop Spanish interpreter used. Patient willing and able to participate in teaching session regarding inpatient colonoscopy prep. Per Stephanie Doherty, NP. anticipated date of colonoscopy is 3/2/2015. Discussed plan for preparation, possible side effects of prep and definition of clear output indicating readiness for procedure. Patient reports history of constipation and last recorded BM was on 2/24 according to nursing notes Handout Inpatient Colonoscopy Preparation given to patient. Patient verbalized understanding of teaching and will notify her nurse of any questions or side effects during the prep process.  


For primary team: Please order colonoscopy prep through POE Sets  Templates (this adds 10 mg Dulcolax to 6 L NuLytely and includes nursing orders): Orders > Write > Sets/Templates > Department > GI service >2 day Inpatient Colonoscopy Prep. Please order this prep am of 2/28 and note that patient will be on clear liquid diet for Saturday and Sunday prior to procedure with NuLytely prep beginning on Sunday. 


For nursing staff: Patient should drink 8 ounces of prep solution every 15-20 minutes. If nauseated, advise her to wait for 30 minutes then resume in smaller amounts. Please offer baby wipes and barrier cream to patient (can be ordered from Materials Management). Drinking through a straw and sucking on hard candy or lemons can help make the prep more tolerable. Output should be light yellow or green with little sediment at end of prep. To assist with determining if patient is clear, please draw an X with permanent marker on bottom of hat or commode prior to starting prep. Patient is complete with colonoscopy prep when X can be clearly read.  


The GI team will touch base with the primary team and nurse regarding the timing of procedure on Monday. If any questions please contact us.

Time:  6:15 PM 


I him asked by Dr. Steiner to see this patient as part of an evaluation for cardiac transplantation.  Her husband was present as was the interpreter.  She is Spanish speaking. 


HPI: this 35 year old female as a history of CM due to Chagas, AMI with an embolic event 2010 and several recent exacerbations of heart failure treated at BMC. She presented to our hospital for a second opinion regarding advanced therapies. Earlier in 2015 she was admitted to another hospital, suffered cardiogenic shock and the spontaneous abortion of a 19 week old fetus. Per report she has been followed by Cardiology at BMC as an outpatient. Reportedly the patient was not considered to be a good candidate for VAD as she lacked insight into the severity of her disease. 

                She says that the first time that the possibility of having a transplant was mentioned was here at MGH. She says that it is a long process and that it is good news and offers hope. I asked her how she felt about using birth control. She said that it was a drastic step of that she understands she has the understanding and approval of her church. He said that she is trying accept it. As well, she said that she had been planning to attend meetings at her church that, I believe, had to do with planning family and pregnancies. 

                I asked if she had ever seen a Psychiatrist before. She says that she thinks she may have seen a Psychologist and/or a Social Worker in the clinic in East Boston where she receives her primary care. She seemed to know the name of her Cardiologist The Infectious Disease specialist and her Primary Care Dr.

When seen she was sitting up in a chair and her husband and the interpreter were present. She had just completed a fairly long interview. She greeted me pleasantly with a smile. Eye contact was fair as he was looking some toward the interpreter. Her speech seemed normal in volume, rate and rhythm. She described her mood as tired but okay. She did smile a few times during the interview. Her thinking seemed clear and linear in nature. There was no evidence of thought disorder. It is a little difficult to assess her fund of knowledge but it did seem okay. Of course, they are learning a tremendous amount about the possible road ahead. Her judgment seemed fair. 


V 49.83 Awaiting Organ Transplant 


Impression: This young woman has no psychiatric history nor any history of abuse. It would seem that the major concern going forward would be compliance in that compliance might be somewhat limited by her support system and the demands of her wife and they possibly limited support system. However, she described transplant process as a long process she views with hope and sees as good news. 

                Will discuss further in team.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 


 Social Work Note:
 Sally Keck, Heart Transplant Coordinator, and I met with husband and Felix Medical Interpreter, and many concerns were identified.
_Finances are very tight, so they rent 2 rooms in their apartment to 2 men and have very small space for themselves and their 2 children. The 2 men are not neat, so Maria has to clean up after them. Maria said they need a bigger place to live, but it did not seem clear that she appreciated the problem with getting a larger apartment with limited resources.
_Maria is not able to care for their younger child (13 months old, weighs 20#, is starting to walk a little). Husband has to drive child from one friend_s home to another in different towns for child care, sometimes paying a little for it and sometimes not. Husband says the 6yo is OK, doing fine. _Husband seems understandably overwhelmed by all of their problems. He said at first he coped OK, but now his head is full of all the information, and he sometimes forgets to do things. He gets some sleep (about 5 hours) but often wakes and then cannot get back to sleep.
_Husband seems worried about possibility of heart transplant and risk of infection due to immunosuppression, and he asked if VAD can last several years. When asked about caregiver for her after either VAD or Heart Transplant, pt and husband referred to Derly, the friend who had been present during my afternoon meeting with pt (and the person who had asked if hospital can provide child care and rides to medical appointments).
_Pt has medical transportation authorized with PT-1 form, but when they call about arrangements and she does not speak English, they hang up on her. The Ride may be a possibility, but language may still be somewhat of a barrier.
_Husband mentioned that he has a court date in April because he was stopped by the police and charged with driving without a license. He has driver_s license in El Salvador, but it is not in effect in Massachusetts.

Husband sais his boss knows about Maria_s health problems and wants to help. If husband tells him about appointments ahead of time, he can have time off. Husband_s days off are Monday and Friday, so Sally and I will meet again Monday at 1pm to continue education about transplant process and expectations of caregivers, and their plan for who can take on these responsibilities

DENTAL CONSULTATION 

ID/CC:              Asked to see this 35 year old female admitted on 2/17/15  with heart failure. Dental evaluation requested prior to heart transplant. 

HPI:      (adapted from medical record)  

Ms. Ortiz is a 35 year old female with CAD, NYHA-IV CHF (2/2 Chagas Cardiomyopathy) with dual chamber AICD who usually gets care at BMC. She was recently admitted to BMC (1/2 to 1/14) for cardiogenic shock in the setting of being pregnant (with resulting spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus). She presented to MGH for heart failure evaluation.   


At MGH, patient received a TTE with 10% EF, BiV failure with mod to severe MR and mod TR. Her blood pressures were originally high 80s to low 90s systolic, with warm extremities and a lactate of 3.3 that has since downtrended to stable 2.5. Heart failure evaluated patient for advanced therapies or cardiac transplant. SDU has been diuresing her since her dry weight is closer to 54Kg (119lbs), and she presented to MGH weighing 126lbs, +JVD up to neck and abdominal distention/nausea and bloating. She was on home torsemide 5mg QD when she first came in. SDU escalated this to 80mg of IV lasix BID for TBB of at least negative 1.5L. She is still undergoing workup for heart transplant.

Reason for Consult:  Pre Transplant Evaluation 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:    

Ms Ortiz is a 35 y/o woman from El Salvador with Chagas cardiomyopathy s/p AICD and subsequent NYHA-II heart failure with recent decompositions requiring admission at BMC (1/2/15-1/14/15) for cardiogenic shock resulting in shock liver and spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus, who was admitted to MGH on 2/17 with worsening heart failure and is now being evaluated for heart transplant.  


She suffered a thromboembolic a acute anterior STEMI in 2010. She has suffered a number of heart failure exacerbations thought to be due to non-compliance. She was diagnosed with Chagas in 8/2011 with confirmatory serologies by CDC. She was followed by Drs. Manish Sagar and Laura Chamberlain form ID at BMC. She was evaluated for treatment by the CDC and was accepted. AN IND was filled and benznidazole was obtained but she never followed up. Each time she presented to medical care she was either pregnant or breast-feeding so treatment was never pursued.  


This exacerbation was caused by influenza dx at OSH s/p oseltamavir. She is currently being evaluated for heart transplant.  


She received ivermectin X 2 doses.  


Vaccinations: 

She had influenza vaccine in 2013. She has not has pneumococcal vaccine, Hepatitis B vaccine, or TdaP.

Ms Ortiz is a 35 y/o woman from El Salvador with Chagas cardiomyopathy s/p AICD and subsequent NYHA-II heart failure with recent decompositions requiring admission at BMC (1/2/15-1/14/15) for cardiogenic shock resulting in shock liver and spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus, who was admitted to MGH on 2/17 with worsening heart failure and is now being evaluated for heart transplant. She has end stage cardiomyopathy with an EF < 10% and is being evaluated for transplant. Current guidlines do not recommend pre-transplant Benzinadazole. She is currently complaining of several GI symptoms which may be related to CHagas disease despite lack of evidence of organ enlargement on current imaging. Would have GI evaluate her symptoms. She would be monitored with weekly labs post transplant and treated if there is evidence of paracitemia. She will also need screening for other endemic chronic infections (outlined below). She will also require several pre-transplant vaccinations.  


RECOMMENDATIONS  Diagnostic   Please send HIV and HTLV  Please send stool for O and P Please have fungal panel send to CDC for paracocci and coccioides Await IGRA results Would have her evaluated by GI to assess symptoms: Odynophagia/dysphagia, gastritis and constipation Therapeutic    Please Vaccinate with PCV 13 (Prevnar)  She will require PPV 23 (pneumovax in 8 weeks) Please give TDaP Please give influenza vaccine Please give high dose Hepatitis B vaccine (40 mcg) IM X 1  She will require doses 2 and 3 separated by one month 

  The CDC recommends HIV testing for all patients in health care settings.  


Patient discussed with Dr. Mansour. Recommendations communicated verbally to primary team.  Thank you for the consult.  We will follow with you.

Transplant ID Attending Note   


We were asked for by Dr. Semigran to see this patient for pre-transplant evaluation for OHT (previously seen by general ID on this admission). I performed an independent exam, discussed management and plan with Dr. Zanoni, Infectious Diseases fellow and agree with his plan. My additions to the plan have been incorporated into the above note. Briefly, 35 yo woman with positive Chagas serology, severe CMP with EF10% s/p AICD and recent hospitalization for CHF exacerbations who has been transferred to MGH for OHT consideration. As noted, pt originally from El-Salvador grew up in low SES. Has been followed at BMC for CHF for several years, found to have Chagas positive serology (w/CDC confirmation) with plans for treatment with benznidazole, but not completed for unclear reasons (patient did not return?). Recently she had influenza resulting in CHF exacerbation and transfer to MGH. Today, she feels well. She is in the CSICU on ionotropes. Tells us that she is breathing fine, but endorses long standing constipation, and possible dysphagia with sensation of chest discomfort with swallowing solids.  

On exam, pt is confortable, seated in a chair, speaking in full sentences. Hemodynamically stable. Anicteric. Good air movement without wheezing or crackles, symmetric chest rise on palpation. regular rate, no m, prominent S4. soft, NT + BS. No edema. R IJ with PA line. 

Serologies reviewed as in Dr Zanonis note. 


Imp: 35 yo woman with Chagas CMP exacerbated by influenza infection here for OHT consideration. We are asked to evaluate her for transplantation from ID perspective. Her CHF is quite end-stage and given the toxicities associated with treatment, we favor holding on treatment in the setting of OHT, monitoring for parasitemia post OHT with buffy coat examinations and treating if positive. Of note, her GI symptoms could be consistent with Chagas involvement of esophagus or colon, I agree with GI evaluation (barium swallow, possible endoscopy). We have also outlined several other serologies and vaccines to be performed on this admission.  


Case discussed in detail with Infectious Diseases Fellow, Dr. Zanoni.  I saw and evaluated the patient, and reviewed the fellow's note above and agree with their history, exam, lab review, radiology review, and other test results, and their assessment and recommendations for care. We discussed the prior history in significant detail with the referring team, along with our findings and recommendations. Complexity of medications with high potential for interactions requiring intensive monitoring noted. Antibiotic doses adjusted for estimated renal function when necessary. Evaluation of allergy status performed. Possible need for alternative therapy noted.  Need for infectious disease precautions evaluated. Vaccination status reviewed and recommendations made.  Transfer of complete care for this condition not anticipated. I have co-written the above note and incorporated additional information and recommendations.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  

Please see admission note for details of Maria Ortiz's presentation.  


In brief, Ms. Ortiz is a 35 year old female with CAD, NYHA-IV CHF (2/2 Chagas Cardiomyopathy) with dual chamber AICD (dry weight 54 kg) who usually gets care at BMC (by Claudia Hochberg; 781-927-4788, 617-953-2734, email: claudia.hochberg@bmc.org) who was recently admitted to BMC (1/2 to 1/14) for cardiogenic shock in the setting of being pregnant (with resulting spontaneus abortion of a 19 week fetus) presenting here for heart failure evaluation.  


We got a TTE with 10% EF, BiV failure with mod to severe MR and mod TR. Her blood pressures were originally high 80s to los 90s systolic, was mentating, warm extremities and had a lactate of 3.3 that has since downtrended to stable 2.5. We consulted heart failure for evaluation for advanced therapies or cardiac transplant. We have been diuresing her since her dry weight is closer to 54Kg (119lbs), and she came in with 126lbs, +JVD up to neck and abdominal distention/nausea and bloating. She was on home torsemide 5mg QD when she first came in. We have escalated this to 80mg of IV lasix BID for TBB of at least negative 1.5L. She is still undergoing workup for heart transplant. Gynecology was consulted on 2/24 to talk to her about contraceptives. 


We have talked extensively with Ms. Ortiz about the danger of getting pregnant, as it causes her circulatory collapse from cardiogenic shock. She is a very religious catholic and asked for a priest to come and talk to her about whether or not an exception can be made for her to get contraception. A priest was called in on 2/23 to talk to her about whether or not she might be eligible for an exception. Father Joseph granted her an exception on 2/25 to get contraception given her clinical status. On 2/26, she got mexplanon contraceptive implanted in her arm. 


She received ivermectin dose for empiric tx of strongyloides and serology was sent. On 2/24 PM, metolazone 2.5mg x1 was added to regimen to help her diurese further, as she has more abdominal distention and nausea, likely due to high filling pressures. Her TBB was -2.1L and weight 119 on 2/26.  A right heart cath was planned for 2/25 by Heart failure team with likely plans to go to a unit for inotrope support.

Consult Completed with the Help of a Spanish Interpreter on the Blue Phone 


Consult Question: Contraception (permanent vs LARC)  i/s/o severe heart failure 2/2 Chagas disease 


ID/HPI: 35yo G7P3043 with severe heart failure (EF 10%) secondary to Chagas Disease who presented to MGH for a second opinion after a recent admission to BMC where she was told that she has months to live. Ms. Ortiz was recently admitted to BMC in cardiogenic shock in the setting of pregnancy which led to miscarriage of her 19 week fetus. The patient is going to be evaluated for heart transplant.  Patient first needs to be evaluated for non-compliance.  Patients most recent pregnancy was in the setting of her known Chagas CM and recommendation to not get pregnant.  The primary team has requested a GYN consult to help encourage patient to consider LARC or permanent sterilization. Ms. Ortiz reports that she has always been Catholic but that her faith has changed in recent years and she has become much more devout.  She has used contraception in the past including an IUD (possibly the copper IUD) and injections (possibly Depo). She reports not liking the IUD that she had as it caused some abdominal cramping and menorrhagia. Since becoming more devout patient reports that she has a better understanding of sanctity of life.  She stopped using birth control at that time. She has been trying to use the natural family planning method.  This lead to her most recent pregnancy that resulted in a second trimester miscarriage in the setting of cardiogenic shock.

Assessment/Recommendations:    

Patient expresses understanding of her critical medical status and why contraception is being recommended for her.  She understands the importance of not becoming pregnant. I acknowledged patients religious beliefs and explained that there are times when science and religion contradict eachother and that this is not uncommon in OB/Gyn. I explained that our priority is to keep her safe and alive so that she can be a mother to her children at home. She ultimately would like to do something for contraception that her church or that a priest would agree with. I explained that while natural family planning is a great it is not 100% effective. We STRONGLY recommend something more effective than natural family planning as it has failed for her in the past. I explained how the Mirena IUD works including thickening cervical mucous and stopping ovulation and reinforced that it prevents conception but does not work as an abortive agent.  Of note I discussed with the patient that her decision would be confidential from her family if she would like. I explained that when the IUD is in place, partners are unable to tell with intercourse. Patient expressed understanding of her options. She would like to discuss with a priest and then let Gyn known when she has made a decision. 


# Contraception:  If patient agrees would recommend tubal ligation (if stable for surgery) vs Mirena IUD (5 years) vs Nexplanon (3 years).  Of note both LARC methods if they remain in place likely have longer lasting effects. Would ultimately recommend a bilateral tubal ligation when patient is medically stable.  Mirena or Nexplanon could be placed easily while in house.    


# Religion/ Ethics: Patient ultimately would like a blessing from a priest.  From a medical perspective would recommend that this patient get blessed from a priest due to the severity of her medical situation and the dangerous nature of pregnancy in a patient who has heart failure. Would recommend an ethics consult to review case if this is not found.    


Thank you for this consult. Please page with any further questions or when patient makes a decision regarding IUD vs Nexplanon.

Name: Maria Ortiz
MRN: 5565319
Address: 83 Florence Ave., Apt 1
 Revere, MA 02151
H: 781-917-4788
Next of Kin: Angel Gonzalez, husband

Date: 2/23/2015
Time: 5PM
Primary Language: English
Requires/Would benefit from interpreter: N/A
Sources of Information: Patient, friends and medical record

Presenting Problem: Maria Ortiz is a 35yo woman with severe systolic dysfunction due to Chagas diagnosed 8/2011, s/p ICD, s/p AMI 2010, recent HF exacerbations who was referred for psychosocial assessment for heart transplant evaluation.

Personal History/Patient_s Family of Origin: Pt was born and raised in El Salvador and came to the United States in 2006. Her father was killed in the civil war when she was 1yo, and her mother (approx. 58yo) has 3 younger children (24yo sister, 23yo brother and approx. 18yo brother).

Current Primary Social Supports: Pt has been together with her husband (Angel, 35yo, works as a chef at Atlantic Fish Co.) for 13 years, and they have been married 3 years. They have 3 children:
_Jimena Guadalupe Gonzalves Ortiz is 13yo and lives with pt_s mother and siblings in El Salvador.
_Angel Gonzalves Ortiz, 6yo _ lives with parents
_Emanuel Elias Gonzalves Ortiz, 13 months old _ lives with parents
Pt recently had miscarriage at 19 wks gestation.

Derly is a close friend who is helping to care for pt_s children. She lives in Revere (C: 857-204-3762). Derly_s daughter speaks good English and can be called to help with communication (Dahiana Lopez C: 781-632-8092).

Educational and Vocational History (Include Military Service if applicable): Pt went to school from about 12-18yo and advanced to 6th grade. She says that she had other issues to deal with and had to stop studying from time to time. She has done some temporary work in the U.S. in a printing company and factories.

Finance, Insurance and Medications: Income is from husband_s employment. Medical insurance is MassHealth product, which she has because of her children, and she has changed from BMC Healthnet to another product which will accept MGH as provider.

Health Care Proxy: Pt completed HCP designating husband, Angel Gonzalez, as proxy. If is it not available in documentation from BMC, she would be glad to complete another HCP here.

Safety History: Pt denies history of abuse.

Substance Abuse History: Pt has never smoked cigarettes or used illicit drugs. She has tried alcohol, but she drinks it very little and is not a _social drinker_.

Mental Health History: Pt denies any history of depression or anxiety. She has had scans to assess medical condition and had no claustrophobia and denies feeling nervous. She seemed uncertain when talking about Chagas and said that she had not followed through with treatment because of pregnancy and later breastfeeding, and she said she continued to see cardiologist but not ID consultants because she was told that damage to her heart had already been done.

Spiritual: Pt believes what is first is the church, God and friendships from the church. Pt is active in Immaculate Conception Church in East Boston, and there is a Franciscan Father through a church in Roxbury who visited her at BMC. MGH Chapel, Catholic Channel on TV and referral for Chaplain were discussed. She has already received communion for which she is grateful.

Legal: Pt has never been arrested.

Goals: Pt hopes to have heart transplant evaluation so that she can be with husband and children as they grow up.

Current Functioning (Impact of Current Illness): Pt_s cardiac problems and heart attack were diagnosed 5 years ago, but her condition has gotten significantly worse this year. When she is _pain free_, she can manage to get around and do things. However, when she has pain, she stays in bed and cannot do things. She described pain as being in her stomach which becomes distended, and in her throat so that she experiences nausea and difficulty swallowing, and she becomes short of breath. She cannot lie down with pillows and has to either sit or stand to be comfortable. Pt has never participated in sports other than physical education in school, and she has not been physically active.

Coping: 
 1) Do you have any questions about today_s pt/family education session? No
2) Do you understand the possible psychosocial risks after transplant such as depression, post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, guilt and concern about dependence on others? Yes
3) What coping strategies have been helpful in the past? She controls her nervousness by having faith and trusting in the people around her.
4) Do you understand the risks and benefits of transplantation? Yes
5) Do you have any trouble taking your medication or attending medical appointments? (If yes, high risk indicator) No, the VNA has helped, but she sets up her own medication box if they are not available. She takes very little medication.

Patient Strengths: Pt has loving relationship with husband and children and hopes to be able to have heart transplant.

Transplant Education and Resources
_Medications - lifelong daily immunosuppressants
_Information re: fundraising 
_Lifelong sobriety if there is a history of addictions
_Transportation: frequent doctor visits 1-3x weekly post transplant
oDriving time _ - 1 hour
oHow - car
oWho _ husband
oLodging - sometimes overnight _ N/A

Assessment: Further assessment of pt_s understanding and insight into her medical problems is recommended. Pt_s friend Derly asked if hospital can provide assistance with child care and rides to medical appointments. Pt has had PT-1 form submitted authorizing transportation to medical appointments paid for by MassHealth, but she has not used it because of language issues and difficulty communicating.

Plan: 
oSocial work contact information for this social worker was given to pt and friends
oWill discuss with transplant team_ 
oWill remain available for support and resources as necessary_

EVALUATION:  PT dx: Patient presents with impaired aerobic capacity and endurance associated with deconditioning and cardiovascular pump dysfunction.  


Upon evaluation today patient presents with an abnormal hemodynamic response to activity on level surfaces and on stairs and is independent with all mobility.  Pt would benefit from ongoing physical therapy to teach patient an how to perform the appropriate level of activity and exercise that will benefit their recovery.  Pt would also benefit from phase III outpatient cardiac rehab after discharge from MGH.   


Anticipated Goals and Expected Outcomes: (within 7 days) 

1.       Patient verbalizes understanding of pacing strategies 

2.       Patient demonstrates understanding of home exercise program/walking program 

3.       Patient verbalizes understanding of proper termination of exercise  

4.       Patient verbalizes role of cardiac rehab 


Goals/Plan discussed with and agreed to by patient and family?     Yes      

 Plan of Care*:      Frequency: 3 x wk 

Pt education regarding role of PT, goals of exam, discharge plan, use of RPE/DOE/talk test for activity monitoring, signs/symptoms for activity termination, heart failure exercise booklet and independent aerobic conditioning program, benefits of cardiac rehab, provided pt with cardiac rehab contact information, pt education regarding modifiable risk factors for heart, benefits of regular aerobic/strength training program in cardiac disease prevention 



*The patients progress will be assessed at each session. The frequency may be increased or tapered as treatment progresses based on the therapists judgment of factors including but not limited to; co morbidities, tissue healing, patient/caregiver independent self management, ability to participate  in/receive therapy due to medical stability and/or competing care priorities.

 Reason for visit:
 Endstage systolic heart failure related to Chagas

 Interval History:
 35 yo female w/ severe systolic dysfunction 2/2 Chagas CM s/p ICD, AMI w/ embolic event in 2010, several recent heart failure exacerbations at BMC presented to MGH ER yesterday for 'second opinion' in regards to advanced therapies. Most recent admission earlier this year was complicated by cardiogenic shock and spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus requiring inotropic therapy. Her RHC data close to presumed dry weight reported as CO 4.1, SVR of 1033, MVO2 53. Discharge weight 54 kg on low dose lasix, dig and hydral. Her last TTE on 02/28/15 includes an EF of 10%), LVIDD 73, RVSP 35 mm Hg, mod to sev MR, mild to mod TR, significant RV hypokinesis.

Reportedly, patient followed at BMC cardiology department intermittently follow up as outpatient. Her systolic function became after the delivery of her first baby 2 years ago, transplant listing was jeopardized at that point of time due to her illegal status in the US. Patient never received treatment for her Chagas. Based on reports from her primary cardiologist, patient was also not considered to be good candidate for DT LVAD placement. Apparently, patient lacked insight in the severity of the disease. 

Her physicians indicate that the patient has not shown much insight. Although BMC does not have a program of advanced therapies it is thought the she would not be a good VAD candidate as destination therapy might be a dead end and moreover that the patient would not be able to manage it. She does not seem to understand the severity of the disease and her insight is poor (Jennifer Ho 617 638-8700). 

 Past medical history:
 1. Hypertension 
2. CHF NYHF Class 2 
- Query Chagas 
3. CAD: She presented in October of 2010 with chest pain and anterior STEMI and underwent coronary angiography revealing 40% mid stenosis and distal occlusion of the LAD. Ventriculogram revealed apical ballooning with EF 0.45 out of proportion to the LAD occlusion. No intervention was performed. 
4. Anemia 
5. Fetal Demise

No obvious hard road blocks identified for this young mother, however social circumstances and hx of non-compliance needs to be investigated further before officially starting an transplant evaluation. 

# Decompensated systolic heart failure w/ borderline cardiac output
- JVD still significantly elevated, would use at least torsemide 10 mg po BID for adequate diuresis
- will need to review prior reactions to standard CHF regimen, since patient not on BB, ACEI, or aldacton
- target weights closer to 154 lbs
- treating underlying Chagas most likely would not significantly affect overall systolic dysfunction or prognosis at this stage
- please obtain OSH results documenting Chagas, agree w/ ID consultation

# Advanced therapies
- will advance financial coordinator and social worker for some initial screening
- plan to discuss w/ outpatient provider Dr. Ho tomorrow

 Narrative Note:
 Patient seen and examined. Reviewed telemetry, 12-lead ECG, imaging studies, and laboratory data. Discussed with Dr. J. Sanchez and I agree with his note. Briefly, 35-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy thought to be secondary to Chagas disease. She has previously been treated at BMC. At the time of presentation, she is moderately fluid overloaded but comparatively well compensated. Will continue to diurese today and will also get the advice of the heart failure team regarding next steps, vis a vis possible treatment for Chagas disease and further management of her heart failure, including possible candidacy for mechanical support in the future.

REASON FOR CONSULT: Treatment of chronic Chagas disease 


HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: 

Ms Ortiz is a 35 y/o woman from El Salvador who carries the diagnosis of Chagas cardiomyopathy, previously documented as being NYHA-II heart failure who had a recent hospitalization at BMC (1/2/15-1/14/15) in cardiogenic shock, c/b shock liver, and spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus, who was admitted to MGH for a second opinion on heart failure evaluation and management. ID is being consulted regarding treatment of chronic Chagas disease. 


Ms Ortiz has had an extensive cardiac history, previously very carefully documented in Dr. Guseh's note; briefly she suffered an acute anterior STEMI thought to be thromboembolic in 2010; she had beta blockade but developed high-grade conduction delay and she was worked up for cardiomyopathy with underlying conduction disease. Over the ensuing years she was managed medically and had many herat failure exacerbations and was nonadherent to many medicaiton regimens. She feels that 2 years ago she became acutely worse; at that time it is noted that she had become pregnant, which led to decrease in her EF. She was monitored carefully. She states that it was at that time that she was diagnosed with Chagas; OSH records suggest she was diagnosed 8/2011, with IgG positivity (IgM negative), no PCR performed. Serologies sent to the CDC were confirmed positive. 


Dr. Elkhoury spoke with her ID physician Dr. Manish Sagar today who described that Ms. Ortiz had been evaluated with serologies, and when positive, experts at CDC had been consulted to consider whether to treat this young woman of childbearing potential with advanced cardiomyopathy, disease category which was previously declined treatment for Chagas. It was determined that she would benefit from Chagas treatment, and Dr. Sagar completed an IND for use of benznidazole in this woman. However, she never followed-up in clinic and each time she presented to medical care it was in the context of having become pregnant or while breastfeeding, for which risks outweighed benefits of treatment. She was last seen in ID clinic at BMC on 3/7/14. 


As previously documented, Dr. Sagar, as well as Dr. Laura Beth Chamberlain with whom I spoke today, commented that the patient has not been reliably attending appointments which makes them hesitant to treat Chagas or to offer advanced heart failure therapies (VAD, transplant).  


Currently patient has worsening heart failure symptoms (SOB, fatigue, chest pain) which has led her to seek further care at MGH.  10 days ago she was admitted to Whidden for flu (s/p oseltamivir), and she has remained in decompensated failure since that time.   


In terms of GI symtoms, she has had epigastric pain (attributed to gastritis), but no odynophagia. She has had intermittent diarrhea (1 day here and there over the month), and more problems with constipation. No abdominal pain. She does have occasional esophageal dysphagia. 


She had a recent admission to Whidden hospital 10 days ago for fatigue, myalgia, fever and cough. Influenza test was positive and she completed a course of tamiflu. Currently, patient denies fever, chills but she continues to have a cough, runny nose (white discharge) and sore throat.

IMPRESSION: 

Ms Ortiz is a 35 y/o woman from El Salvador with heart failure due to Chagas cardiomyopathy who had a recent hospitalization at BMC (1/2/15-1/14/15) with cardiogenic shock requiring inotrope support, shock liver, and spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus; also with recent admission to Whidden hospital for influenza with decompensated heart failure, who was admitted to MGH for a second opinion on heart failure evaluation and management. ID is being consulted regarding treatment of chronic Chagas disease. 


Her BMC providers have done a very complete evaluation of Ms. Ortiz and have spoken with Dr. Susan Montgomery of the CDC regarding treatment of Chagas in a patient with advanced heart failure. Current expert opinion guidelines suggest that all patients with acute infection be treated, as well as congenital infection, reactivation, or in children under 18 years of age. In patients 19-50 who are not in advanced heart failure, treatment should also be offered and a discussion about side effects had; and in advanced heart failure, one should reassess with expert opinion. A review is listed (Bern et al, JAMA 2007 Vol 298, No. 18). In her case, the CDC recommended to pursue treatment and Dr. Sagar acquired the IND for benznitazole; the patient was not able to present for treatment. 


We would agree with offering treatment to this patient, understanding that there are significant adverse side effects (rash, severe allergic dermatitis, colitis) but do not feel any rush to treat her. This can be done as an outpatient and she is encouraged to f/u with the provders at BMC who know her well, or she is welcome to see us in outpatient clinic for management. 


Recommend: 

- Would send T cruzi PCR to r/o active disease 

- Please let us know about her cardiac plan; if she is to be listed for transplant here we are happy to evalute her for pre-transplant evaluation and would strongly favor to treat her T cruzi prior to immunosuppression out of risk for relapse.

Infectious Disease Attending Note:  

Chart reviewed, patient examined and case discussed with Dr. Chu; please see her detailed note above. I agree with her Hx, exam, assessment and recommendations. Ms. Ortiz is a 35 y/o woman from El Salvador with heart failure due to Chagas cardiomyopathy who had a recent hospitalization at BMC (1/2/15-1/14/15) with cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic support, shock liver, and spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus; also with recent admission to Whidden hospital for influenza with decompensated heart failure, who was admitted to MGH for a second opinion for heart failure evaluation and management. We are being consulted regarding treatment of chronic Chagas disease.  

I reviewed her ROS, PMHx, SHx, FHx, current meds and allergies as detailed above. 

On exam, also detailed above, Tm 99 Tc 98.3 P74 BP95/60 RR18 98 RA. She is alert, 

communicative in NAD. Her lungs are clear, he heart is regular, she has a pronounced 2/6 S murmur at the apex, PMI laterally displaced, her abdomen is soft non tender. She has bi pedal trace edema. She is moving all her extremities, and her neuro exam is non focal. She has no rashes and no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis. 

I reviewed her labs and imaging as detailed above. 

At this point, we reviewed her extensive medical records from BMC, she has + anti-Trypanosomal IgG with a high titer and negative IgM supporting the diagnosis of chronic Chagas in this 35 yo w from El Salvador. I also spoke w Dr. Manish Sagar her ID physician at BMC. Dr Sagar coordinated Ms. Ortiz care with Dr. Montogomery at the CDC. The CDC provided the antiparasitic drug Benznidazole for treatment of Chagas, but the patient was unable to start the course of therapy on multiple occasions because of pregnancy or breast feeding, so the drug had to be returned to the CDC. Dr Sagar offered today to restart the process of obtaining Benznidazole to initiate therapy if Ms. Ortiz wishes to be treated at BMC. We recommend obtaining PCR for Chagas and agree with the plan for initiating therapy which can be done at BMC. However such a regimen is associated with potential for significant side effects and the patient requires close f/u and willingness to comply. If the patient is definitely being considered for a heart transplant, then we will initiate a comprehensive pre-transplant evaluation from ID perspective and will then expedite starting Chagas therapy. 

Please see additional recommendations in Dr Chus note above. 


Thanks for the consult, will follow with you.

 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 

 Reason for visit:
 Asked by the Emergency Department to assist with this woman in heart failure.

 Interval History:
 Maria Ortiz 
MGH MRN 556-53-19 (BMC MRN 3493921) 

She is a 35 year old woman with NYHA Class 2 Heart Failure due to primary Chagas Cardiomyopathy (Dual Chamber AICD; dry weight 54 kg) who was recently admitted to Boston Medical Center (1/2 to 1/14) where her course was complicated by cardiogenic shock, shock liver, and spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus requiring inotropic therapy. Her admission weight was 60.8 kg and her discharge weight was 54.3 kg. She was discharged on 40 mg of intravenous lasix digoxin and hydralazine. 

She has had many heart failure exacerbations. However, during her most recent and most severe heart failure admission at BMC she had a spontaneous abortion and developed shock liver with hepatocellular enzymes in exceess of 3800 (greater than the BMC assay). A RHC had a CO of 1.8, CI 1.1, SVR 2741, MVO2 31 and PCWP of 23. She was treated with milrinone and dobutamine gtt with captopril, digoxin, and hydralazine. Her RHC pressures would improve with CO 4.1, SVR of 1033, MVO2 53. Her course was further c/b significant ventricular ectopy. A beta-blocker was withheld given concern for hemodynamic embarrassment. She was advised to avoid pregnancy. 

Her last TTE on 01/07/15 includes an EF of 0.21 (biplane), LVIDD 80, RVSP 38 mm Hg. She has biatrial enlargement with septal bowing to the right. There was moderate to severe MR and mild to moderate TR. 

She has presented today (2/18) to the MGH ED largely for second opinion. She also had a recent hospitalization at Whidden Hospital for influenza where she was treated with influenza. Her last full set of full vitals in the ED at 9AM include: T98.0, HR 72 BP 93/67 RR 16 and saturating 98 on ambient air. In the ED here she had a short 6 beat salvo of NSVT seemingly arising from the LV apex. 

* 

Her device is a Boston Scientific PUNCTUA (model #E052, serial #100348; implant date 5/8/2014). The device is programmed DDR with lower rate limit of 60 bpm, max sensor rate of 140 bpm, sensed/paced AV delay of 220/250 ms, and VF zone > 200 bpm with with 26J then full output. 

* 

I have spoken at length with Dr. Claudia Hochberg who has treated her for roughly 5 years. Permit me to review, revise and extend upon our conversation. It appears that in 2010 she presented with an anterior STEMI and was rushed to angiography which revealed a distal LAD cutoff that was thought to be thromboembolic. She received medical therapy for coronary disease that included a beta-blocker. However, with beta-blocker therapy she developed high grade block clueing the treating physicians to a cardiomyopathy with underlying conduction disease. 

She was treated medically for some time and did well. She was however, noted to be terribly non-compliant and only would present if very sick. Indeed Dr. Hochberg noted that she saw the patient more inpatient that outpatient. She would have several presentation of decompensated heart failure. She noted that the patient would very quickly decompensate and lives at a low index. 

Two years ago she was doing fine until she became pregnant. This resulted in worsening systolic function. Nevertheless, the baby would do well. Notably this was her second child. A discussion surrounding TRANSPLANT was had after her first child however because the patient is a domiciled in this country and not a U.S. national, this has precluded a transplant listing. 

Regarding her CHAGAS. She has NEVER been treated. Serologies sent to the CDC were indeed positive however every opportunity to treat has been me with pregnancy. Indeed the first attempt to treat the patient was pregnant and the second attempt to treat the patient was breast feeding. 

Her physicians indicate that the patient has not shown much insight. Although BMC does not have a program of advanced therapies it is thought the she would not be a good VAD candidate as destination therapy might be a dead end and moreover that the patient would not be able to manage it. She does not seem to understand the severity of the disease and her insight is poor. 

Nevertheless, the patient is described as trusting, kind, and loving of her two children. 

Her treating physicians at BMC were Claudia Hochberg (Interventional Cardiology 617-953-2734), Blatman (Ob Gyn), and Jennifer Ho (Heart Failure; (617 638-8700). They describe a lack of insight and misunderstanding of the etiology of her demise. Because of her catholic faith is somewhat against . 


 Past medical history:
 1. Hypertension 
2. CHF NYHF Class 2 
- Query Chagas 
3. CAD: She presented in October of 2010 with chest pain and anterior STEMI and underwent coronary angiography revealing 40% mid stenosis and distal occlusion of the LAD. Ventriculogram revealed apical ballooning with EF 0.45 out of proportion to the LAD occlusion. No intervention was performed. 
4. Anemia 
5. Fetal Demise

Vital Signs: Pulse 80 bpm
  BP 97/63 mmHg MAP 75

Physical examination: 
-Neuro: Non focal. Reflexes 2-12 are grosly intact.
-Extremities: Her extremities are WARM.
-Rectal exam: Deferred.
-Abdomen: Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.
-Cardiac: Left ventricular impulse is diffuse and laterally displaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and splitting of S2 and a heard S3 and S4. There is a I/V1 murmur heard at the RUSB that does not radiate.
-Chest: Faint bibasilar rales.
-Neck: The full contour of the JVP is seen at the mandible.
-HEENT: Unremarkable
-Skin: No rashes, anicteric.
-General appearance: No acute distress.

 Assessment and plan:
 She is a 35 year old woman with NYHA Class 2 Heart Failure due to primary Chagas Cardiomyopathy (Dual Chamber AICD; dry weight 54 kg) who was recently admitted to Boston Medical Center (1/2 to 1/14) where her course was complicated by cardiogenic shock, shock liver, and spontaneous abortion of a 19 week fetus requiring inotropic therapy. She present to MGH for a second opionion having been provided a poor prognosis at BMC.

Salient Issues include: 
(1) Heart Failure 

The most accessible evidence of perfusion is blood pressure. Too often recorded casually, the blood pressure requires careful auscultation to determine the width of the pulse pressure. In patients with age and disease severity typical of transplantation candidates, proportional pulse pressure of less than 25% [(systolic - diastolic blood pressure)/systolic blood pressure] suggests a cardiac index, which is calculated as cardiac output in liters per minute divided by body surface area in square meters. Her calculated measurement would be 28%. Her low level lactate (a surrogate of hypoperfusion) however does give me pause and thus at minimum she will require an SDU admission and if her pulse pressure narrows, then CCU admission. One mechanism for this lactate may be poor hepatic clearance given her recent admission with shock liver.

People with Chagas disease (American Trypanosomiasis) may develop progressive and potentially lethal heart conditions. Drugs to eliminate the causative parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, currently in use have limited therapeutic value and are used in early stages of the disease. Extending the use of these drugs to treat symptomatic chronic parasitism with chronic Chagasic cardiopathy (CCC) and progressive dilated cardiomyopathy has been proposed.

Plan:
1. Standing Weight 

2. Heart Failure Evaluation for advanced therapy 

3. Contact Claudia Hochberg (her physician at BMC; 781-927-4788). 

4. AICD Interogration 

5. TTE 

6. Hold beta-blockers as every document suggests that this has been met with shock. 

7. She would benefit from intravenous Iron

8. We will consult infectious disease about T. Cruzi Treatment.

9. Please contact social work.

VS unremarkable, ECG without acute ischemic changes. Patient well-appearing, in no respiratory distress. Exam unremarkable. Bedside echo reveals markedly dilated heart with depressed LVEF, small pericardial effusion. This appears to be chronic in nature and of unknown etiology. Beyond CHF exacerbation/progression of disease, differential diagnosis includes ACS, PE, PTX, PNA, aortic dissection, ongoing symptoms related to previous viral illness. Will plan close monitoring, CXR, labwork including TnT and BNP, medicine admission. ASA x1 now. [js331]

ED Course/Reassessment:2am: Assumed care of pt. 35F Spanish speaking-only, unknown PMH other than "heart flu" followed at OSH who apparently has been told she has "a few months to live," reported recent hospitalization for influenza and completed course of Tamiflu, now presenting with acute-on-chronic malaise, fatigue, intermittent chest pain "right over my heart" which is 4/10 intensity, not present at baseline, and shortness of breath. Patient reports that she did have subjective fevers, URI symptoms 1 week ago, none at present. Pt likely having end stage dilated cardiomyopathy given severed decreased EF on cardiac ultrasound.
